      "SecBio is a digital library for national legislation related to biosafety and biosecurity funded by the French Government. The platform provides a deep dive on a subset of countries' laws and norms, and is currently designed to be used only by government institutions, although parts of the platform may be open to a more general audience in the future. A proposal for the platform was submitted to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) meeting of Experts in August 2021. The proposal is available in English and French, and the platform itself is under development and will also be available in English and French. \n\nSecBio is composed of three main features: 1. a searchable repository for biosafety and biosecurity legal frameworks, treaties, laws, regulations, case law, norms, standards and best practices, 2. a learning module for users to build a project and challenge their knowledge, 3. a forum for expert’s networking to exchange information, data and best practices. The plan for implementation is for France to develop a prototype version of the platform in 2022. The platform would then be administered by the BWC Implementation Support Unit (ISU), with all the information provided by the States. \n\n\n",

      'The WHO Good Distribution Practices for Pharmaceutical Products guidelines outline best practices for ensuring the quality and identity of pharmaceutical products at every point in the distribution process, with a focus on preventing counterfeit products from entering the supply chain.  These guidelines are intended to be applicable to all people and organizations involved in any aspect of the distribution process, including manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, traders, and many others. The guidelines were designed so that government agencies and regulatory bodies would adopt these guidelines to meet the specific needs and situation of their region.\n\nThe guidelines outline six general principles for good distribution practices: 1. All parties along the supply chain are responsible for ensuring the quality of the product, 2. Countries should adopt good practices into their national legislation, 3. These guidelines apply to both sending pharmaceuticals to a patient and receiving recalled pharmaceuticals from a patient, 4. These guidelines also apply to donated pharmaceuticals, 5. Due diligence is needed to ensure traceability and to combat security risks, and 6. There must be collaboration between all parties in the supply chain. These guidelines were published in 2010 and are available in English. \n\n\n',

The guidelines also include the packaging and shipment requirements for sending materials to WHO reference laboratories that verified whether a specimen was positive for the virus. The WHO also published training videos and good practices to accompany these guidelines. \n\nThe guidelines instruct laboratory personnel to conduct a risk assessment to ensure they have the correct safety protocols in place, and they provide a template for performing the risk assessment. It also covers proper disinfection of surfaces and procedures for animals infected with SARS-COV2. The guidelines were written around the time that the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, 4th edition was being released, so the guidelines are written in compliance with the LBM 3rd edition. The guidelines are available in English. \n\n\n',

      'To alleviate concerns about the risk of infection posed by human remains, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has provided International Transport of Human Remains guidance on transporting dead bodies. The guidelines are taken from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) publication "Management of Dead Bodies in Disaster Situations" and the IATA Airport Handling Manual. They may be useful to staff involved in the transportation and clean-up of human remains following disaster situations. The guidance details how to manage bodies to minimize exposure risks, and what to do in the event that body fluid leakage occurs in transport. \n\nIATA, the trade association for world airlines, represents 82% of total air traffic. They are a world leader on aviation policy and work closely with the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to help set international shipping standards, as well as with the WHO. These guidelines were issued in January 2018, and are designed to work with national standards for transportation of human remains. \n\n\n',

      'The Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution describes a set of considerations for the large-scale handling, transportation, and distribution of vaccines as well as other pharmaceutical, life science, and medical products. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) collaborated with several leading authorities, organizations, and global humanitarian agencies to prepare the guide. The 5th edition was published in June 2021 and draws on lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis and helps define future procedures for stakeholders. The Vaccine Guidelines are available in English and Spanish, and users must register in order to access the full document. \n\nIATA, the trade association for world airlines, represents 82% of total air traffic. They are a world leader on aviation policy and work closely with the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to help set international shipping standards. This guidance was released by the IATA Cargo team, which has been working throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to make sure much needed vaccines, medicines and medical equipment are shipped in a safe and timely fashion. \n\n\n',

      'This page describes the kinds of biological substances that meet the criteria of UN 3373 "Biological substance, Category B" as well as the transport packaging regulations that apply to these substances. Any one who prepares and ships substances meeting the UN 3373 criteria is required to know the proper transport regulations. This page can provide a short overview of those substances and regulations.',
    Long_description:
      'This document summarizes the air transport packaging requirements for biological and infectious substances from the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) into a single set of requirements. In cases where the two organizations’ requirements differ, the summarized requirements use the stricter requirements. Additionally, air transport regulations are typically the most restrictive and rigorous of all transport requirements. Shippers who comply with these air transport regulations will also meet the requirements of other modes or transportation. Biological and infectious substances are divided into Category A and B based on the risks that these substances pose to individuals and communities. Category A typically includes pathogens that are capable of causing permanent disability or death in humans and animals. Typically, UN 3373 refers to Category B Biological Substances which encompasses any human or animal specimens that do not contain Category A pathogens. \n\nThe author of this webpage is UN3373.com. UN3373.com is a supplier and retailer of medical mailing packaging and products for mailing biological samples. These products have very specific shipping requirements, and UN3373.com provides guidance on the requirements and products are compliant with international regulations, like International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR), and many post and courier companies. This webpage and other UN3373.com resources were linked to on the IATA website. Packaging biological substances is frequently part of conducting clinical trials, and these resources may be relevant to anyone who needs to ship biological substances. Although, the website appears to only be available in English as of October 2021.\n\n\n',

      'The Global Partnership Initiated Biosecurity Academia for Controlling Health Threats (GIBACBT) is a year-long biosafety and biosecurity fellowship for life science professionals in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Central Asia. There have been 109 fellows from 26 countries across 7 cohorts. Fellows participate in three one-week workshops and have to complete an e-learning course, as well as actively participate in a case study development process and conduct a Scientific Exchange training at their home institution. The fellowship takes place in English, and participants must demonstrate their English proficiency during the application process. \n\nThe fellowship is run by the German Biosecurity Programme (GBP). GBP was founded in 2013 in order to implement sustainable biosafety and biosecurity projects in various countries under the G7 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, and to help strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The GBP is active in nine countries and two regions, with projects focusing on reducing biological threats and strengthening the health capacities of partner countries in Africa, Central Asia and Eastern Europe, thus enhancing their national security. Their projects tackle six main areas: 1. awareness raising, 2. biosafety and biosecurity, 3. surveillance, 4. detection and diagnostics, 5. networking, and 6. capacity development.\n\n\n',

      "These appendices describe revisions to the UN Secretary-General's Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of\nChemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM). The revisions are focused on relevant developments in biotechnology. This is a key document supporting the UNSGM.",
    Long_description:
      'In General Resolution A/42/37C (1987), the UN General Assembly established the UN Secretary General’s Mechanism (UNSGM) to carry out investigations in response to allegations of possible chemical, biological and toxin weapons that may constitute a violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol or other international law. The first set of guidelines for the usage of such a mechanism were established in 1989 by the UN General Assembly document A/44/561. In 2007, the Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) organized a group of experts to discuss and suggest updates to the 1989 guidelines and procedures for the UNSGM. The expert group prepared a set of updated appendices that focus on the relevant guidelines, procedures, and technical aspects of an investigation into the alleged use of a chemical, biological, or toxin weapon. The appendices cover: the type of information to be provided by a Member State in the reporting of a possible chemical, biological, or toxin (CBT) weapon attack to UN Secretary General; the type of information to be provided when the Member States propose experts to assist the UN Secretary General; a list of areas of expertise; a list of equipment and supplies needed for an investigation; and the type of information that Member States need to provide when when proposing laboratories that may analyze samples. The appendices also include guidelines for interviewing witnesses/victims of a potential CBT weapon attack, pre-mission planning, protecting the confidentiality of the investigation, and reporting of investigation activities.\n\nThe UN is an international organization that has 193 Member States as of October 2021. The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the Security Council; the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); the Trusteeship Council; the International Court of Justice; and the UN Secretariat. Each of these organs may issue UN resolutions, but most UN resolutions are issued by either the General Assembly or the Security Council. In addition to the six main bodies of the UN, the larger UN system includes many specialized, international agencies, funds, and programs, including the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The chief administrative officer of the UN is the UN Secretary General. The UN website is available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.\n\n\n',

      'General Assembly resolution A/RES/42/37C (30 November 1987) establishes the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General’s Mechanism (UNSGM) to carry out investigations in response to reports by Member States concerning the possible use of chemical, biological, or toxin weapons. This resolution also mandates that the UN Secretary General develop further technical guidelines and procedures for the management of biological weapons with relevant experts. These experts are to be nominated by the Member States and then listed in a roster maintained by the UN Secretary General. This resolution is a key basis for the UN’s authority to investigate chemical and biological weapons. In 2013, France and the United Kingdom requested that the UN Secretary General use the mechanism established by this resolution to investigate the alleged use of chemical and biological weapons in Syria. Therefore, the document may be most useful for legislative leaders seeking to understand the UN’s ability to investigate chemical, biological, and toxin weapons.\n\nThe UN is an international organization that has 193 Member States as of October 2021. The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the Security Council; the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); the Trusteeship Council; the International Court of Justice; and the UN Secretariat. Each of these organs may issue UN resolutions. However, in practice, most resolutions are issued by either the General Assembly or the Security Council. The General Assembly consists of all the UN Member States, and each Member State has an equal vote in the General Assembly. In addition to the six main bodies of the UN, the larger UN system includes many specialized, international agencies, funds, and programs, including the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The General Assembly issued resolution A/RES/42/37C (30 November 1987). The resolution applies to the UN Secretary General, the chief administrative officer of the UN. Like many UN documents, the text of this resolution is available in English, Arabic, French, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish.\n\n\n',

      'In General Resolution A/42/37C (1987), the UN General Assembly established the UN Secretary General’s Mechanism (UNSGM) to carry out investigations in response to allegations of possible chemical, biological and toxin weapons that may constitute a violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol or other international law. That resolution also requested the UN Secretary General appoint a group of qualified experts to assist in the development of technical guidelines and procedures for the management of biological weapons. The group of experts was assembled and met at Geneva during August 1988. In this document, the experts establish guidelines for sampling, interviewing witnesses, conducting laboratory analyses of evidence, and drafting the resulting investigation report. The appendices of the document cover: the type of information to be provided by a Member State in the reporting of a possible chemical, biological, or toxin (CBT) weapon attack to UN Secretary General; the type of information to be provided when the Member States propose experts to assist the UN Secretary General; a list of areas of expertise; a list of equipment and supplies needed for an investigation; and the type of information that Member States need to provide when proposing laboratories that may analyze samples.\n\nThe UN is an international organization that has 193 Member States as of October 2021.

      'German Online Platform for Biosecurity and Biosafety (GO4BSB) is an e-learning platform created by the German Biosecurity Programme to support their education programs. Started in 2013, it has more than 670 enrolled users from 40 different countries, and aims to raise awareness about biological risks and enable interdisciplinary scientific collaboration. The platform is a collaborative initiative of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Bundeswehr Institute for Microbiology (IMB), the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Island of Riems (FLI), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), and is coordinated by the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM). The platform also launched a GO4BSB COVID-19 Digital Initiative during the pandemic to support scientific exchange and awareness among members. The platform is available in English, French, Russian and German. \n\nThe German Biosecurity Programme (GBP) was founded in 2013 in order to implement sustainable biosafety and biosecurity projects in various countries under the G7 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, and to help strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The GBP is active in nine countries and two regions, with projects focusing on reducing biological threats and strengthening the health capacities of partner countries in Africa, Central Asia and Eastern Europe, thus enhancing their national security. Their projects tackle six main areas: 1. awareness raising, 2. biosafety and biosecurity, 3. surveillance, 4. detection and diagnostics, 5. networking, and 6. capacity development.\n\n\n',

    Short_description:
      'This report describes a series of observations and recommendations by a temporary working group on the implications of the convergence of chemistry and biology for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The working group provides 19 recommendations for the director-general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the implementing body of the CWC. This report may be useful considering the CWC in light of new technologies, like nanotechnology, emerging in chemistry and biology.',
    Long_description:
      'This report contains an assessment of the risks posed by the convergence of biology and chemistry. Convergence in this publication refers to scientists’ increasing knowledge of the fundamental chemistry of living systems and the biology and chemistry production technologies resulting from that understanding. The report argues that convergence is increasing the overlap between the scope of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) because these new technological developments could be used to produce toxic chemicals and toxins through biologically mediated processes. Thus, a working group was assembled by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to study the implications of these new developments for arms control and report their findings in this document.\n\nSince fully understanding the implications of convergence requires experts from a wide range of disciplines, the working group included industrial and academic scientists, defence laboratory scientists, toxicologists, analytical chemists and chemical engineers (including those with experience in bio mediated processes). The complete list of working group members can be found in Annex II of this document. The creation of the working group was proposed by the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) of the OPCW. The OPCW is the intergovernmental body responsible for the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which entered into effect in April 1997. The organization has 193 member states and received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 for its efforts to eliminate the use of chemical weapons worldwide. This document is the final report of the working group, and as of September 2021, the report is only available in English.\n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'This resource is the Robert Koch Institute’s (RKI’s) Code of Conduct for assessing and mitigating the dual use potential of research conducted at the RKI. Dual use potential refers to the potential for certain life sciences research to both contribute to the improvement of society and to potentially be misapplied to the detriment of society and the environment. The RKI aimed to establish a code of conduct that would both preserve the freedom of its researchers while preventing the distribution of data and findings that could harm society or the environment. This code of conduct outlines basic principles for preventing and minimizing dual use risks, criteria for assessing the dual use potential of research, a process for evaluating the dual use potential of research projects, steps for assessing and managing risk, and guidance for developing awareness of the dual use problem at institutions. We have included this resource in the library to provide institutional officials with an example of an institutional code of conduct for minimizing risk in life science research.\n\nThe Robert Koch Institute (RKI) is a German federal government agency and research institute responsible for the investigation, monitoring, and prevention of infectious diseases. RKI is the largest public health institute in Germany and employs over 1000 people, including 450 scientists. The code of conduct is thus available in both English and German. No further updates to the code of conduct are anticipated at this time.\n\n\n',

    Short_description:
      "This handbook strives to provide an introduction to the food and agricultural center, describe the information requirements and investigative procedures of various United States regulatory agencies, identify potential inter-agency conflicts, and enhance the appreciation and understanding of each agency's expertise. It was created to ensure that all available resources and relevant agencies are mobilized in the event of an attack on the U.S. food and agriculture. This handbook can be an example of how to coordinate agencies in the event of agroterrorism.",
    Long_description:
      'This handbook provides an introduction to the food and agricultural sector and to criminal terrorist investigations in the United States. It also seeks to identify potential conflicts between various jurisdictions and agencies that might arise during joint investigations. Ultimately, the handbook aims to enhance the appreciation and understanding between various US agencies and facilitate communication between different officials in the event of a joint investigation of an agroterrorism incident. The handbook is aimed at law enforcement officials in the United States. However, for law enforcement officials outside of the United States, the information in the handbook may also serve as an example of how other countries structure the national regulations and response to potential agroterrorism events. \n\nThis handbook was authored by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (US FBI), and the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). The USDA is the federal executive department responsible for national regulations related to farming, forestry, rural economic development, and food. The FBI is the principal federal law enforcement agency in the United States and serves as one of the nation’s leading organizations on matters related to couter-terrorism and counterintelligence. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is the federal agency responsible for the control, regulation, and supervision of food products, medical drugs and devices, and animal foods and feed. Given the regulatory and investigatory functions of all three agencies, all three agencies could potentially be involved in the investigation of an agroterrorism event in the United States. The handbook also describes several other United States departments and agencies that could be involved in the investigation of an agroterrorism attack. The handbook is only available in English and has not been updated since June 2008. \n\n\n',

      'The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code provides standards for animal health and veterinary public health worldwide. The standards in this code ensure the safety of international trade in animals and animal products and establish measures for the reporting, prevention, and control of pathogenic agents. This code is a key component of the WTO legal framework for international trade. These standards may be useful for members of veterinary and public health services and officials involved in the international trade of animals.\n\nThe OIE is an intergovernmental organization with 182 member countries. The organization is responsible for safeguarding and improving animal health worldwide. OIE receives its mandate from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. It also maintains permanent relations with nearly 75 other international and regional organizations. The development of new and revised standards for the Terrestrial Animal Health Code is the responsibility of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission (the Code Commission). The Code Commission has six elected members and draws up the expertise of internationally renowned experts. Comments from OIE members on the code are solicited twice a year when new or revised texts are made available. The year that a chapter was first adopted and the year of the chapter’s last revision are both included at the end of each chapter. The complete text of the Terrestrial Code is available on the OIE website and individual chapters may be downloaded from the site. The complete code is available in English, French, and Spanish.\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'This resource describes the first two phases of the ongoing project on “Ensuring Effective Inter-Agency Interoperability and Coordinated Communication in Case of Chemical and/or Biological Attacks.” In 2006, the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy called up the United Nations to improve international cooperation and coordination in planning a response to a terrorist attack using chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons. To this end, the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) through its Inter-Agency Working Group on Preventing and Responding to WMD Terrorist Attacks began collaborating with other relevant international stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) on such a project. In 2015, UNOCT began the “Ensuring Effective Inter-Agency Interoperability and Coordinated Communication in Case of Chemical and/or Biological Attacks” project. The project aimed to propose tools that improve the ability of the UN Member States and the broader international community to prevent, counter, and respond to the threat of terrorist attacks with chemical or biological weapons. While the first two phases of the project are complete, Phase III (Implementation) is ongoing. UNOCT anticipates that Phase III will be launched soon. Other updates on the project and its activities can be found on the UN Counterterrorism website linked in this resource’s documentation.\n\nThe United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism was established in June 2017 with the consensus of the 193-nation UN General Assembly. The UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) provides strategic leadership to the United Nations counter-terrorism efforts. UNOCT also works closely with UN Member States, other UN entities, governments, international and regional organizations, academic institutions, and other stakeholders to strengthen efforts to prevent and counter-terrorism. The office collaborates with the Security Council subsidiary committees, including the 1540 committee on the non-proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.

      'In 2014, the Swiss Government initiated a workshop series under the title Spiez CONVERGENCE. The objective of the conference series was to identify developments in chemistry, biology, and related technologies that may have implications for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Participants at the Spiez CONVERGENCE workshops discuss these emerging technologies and potential implications for chemical and biological arms control. Reports on the Spiez Convergence workshops are then published on the Spiez Laboratory’s website. Our library includes a report on the third Spiez Convergence workshop. This workshop occured on September 11-14 2018. The report on the third workshop includes a short description of findings from previous workshops as well as details from discussions on emerging technologies in the areas of synthetic biology, synthetic chemistry, nanotechnology, additive manufacturing, bioinformatics, and big data. The report may be useful for anyone seeking initial insight into the potential implications of those technologies for arms control. The most recent Spiez CONVERGENCE workshop was held on September 13-16 2020, but a report on that workshop’s findings is not yet available on the Spiez Laboratory’s website.\n\nThe workshops are hosted by the Spiez Laboratory. Spiez Laboratory is the Swiss government institute tasked with protecting the population from nuclear, biological, and chemical threats. It is part of the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection, and Sports (DDPS) and is one of the five labs in the world permanently certified by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The Spiez Laboratory website may be viewed in English, German, French, Italian, or English. However, as of September 2021, these specific reports may only be available in English.\n\n\n',

    Short_description:
      'EU CBRN Action B.2 specifies that member states should establish a national registry of facilities possessing high-risk biological agents and toxins, a process for verifying whether those facilities have adequate security arrangements, and a mechanism for regularly reviewing the need for storing those biological agents and toxins. It is part of a larger action plan to reduce the threat of accidental and intentional CBRN incidents. These actions provide guidance and regulations for EU member states and model a high-level regional standard.',
    Long_description:
      'The European Union Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Security Action Plan: Action B.2 dictates that each of the EU member states should establish a registry of facilities within the state possessing any of the substances included on the official EU list of high risk biological agents and toxins. Member states should ensure that each facility has proper security arrangements. Action Plan B.2. further dictates that each state should establish a process for verifying whether the security arrangements at aforementioned facilities are adequate, a record of all high risk materials kept in each facility, and mechanisms for determining whether storing such high risk biological agents and materials is absolutely necessary to. The overall goal of Action B.2 is to reduce the threat of and consequences of CBRN incidents of accidental, natural, or intentional origin, including acts of terrorism. The implementation period for Action B.2 is 2010-2014.\n\nTo assist member states in implementing Action B.2 of the action plan and thus complying with UN Security Council Resolution 1540 (UNSCR 1540) and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), a group of European experts from Denmark, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, The United Kingdom, and Switzerland developed a series of recommendations for each Member State regarding the implementation of Action B.2. The resulting guidelines are published in _Guidelines for the implementation of Action B2_, which we have included as the documentation for this resource. These guidelines may be useful for legislative leaders attempting to bring their own country’s facilities into compliance, or others interested in examples of regional standards for biosecurity.\n\nThe EU CBRN Action Plan was enacted by The Council of the European Union (EU). The Council of the EU (or “The Council”) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the European Union. The Council and the European Parliament negotiate and adopt EU laws as well as the EU budget, based on proposals generated by the European Commission. The Council also coordinates policies for EU member states, develops the EU’s foreign and security policy, and negotiates agreements between the EU and other groups. This regulation, like all EU legislative texts, is available in the official languages of the EU member states (excluding Irish for resource-related reasons)\n\n\n\n',

The group uses data from the World Health Organization's Joint External Evaluation tool to produce a \"ReadyScore\" of a county's pandemic preparedness. Members of low- and middle-income countries can use the resources provided by RSTL to improve their JEE scores, receive training in epidemic preparedness, and identify gaps in their national policies.",
    Long_description:
      'This website, PreventEpidemics.org, publishes country-level data on epidemic preparedness and provides resources to aid public officials in identifying, preventing, and stopping epidemics. The website publishes a “ReadyScore,” a single score designed to capture a country’s pandemic preparedness. The score is based on data from the World Health Organization’s Joint External Evaluation (JEE). The JEE examines the core capacities of countries across 19 technical areas within the framework of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Prevent Epidemics also hosts a library of COVID-19 resources and has published several resources on COVID-19 contact tracing and response. In addition to maintaining the information on the website, the Prevent Epidemics team has partnered with Africa CDC, provided legal analysis to Togo and Gambia, helped expand the yellow fever and measles lab networks in Nigeria, and supported preparedness teams in multiple African nations. The organization also trains healthcare workers and middle managers in Africa.\n\nPreventEpidemics.org is hosted by Resolve to Save Lives. Resolve to Save Lives is an initiative of Vital Strategies, a global public health agency that works with governments and civil organizations in 73 countries to strengthen public health systems. RTSL aids governments in low- and middle-income countries in improving their technical expertise and public health operations. The organization focuses on strengthening seven core preparedness factors: risk assessment and planning; emergency response operations; national laboratory system; disease surveillance; national legislation policy and financing; human resources; and risk communications. Officials within low- and middle-income countries may therefore be most interested in the resources provided by Prevent Epidemics and the Resolve to Save Lives team to improve their country’s epidemic preparedness. The website is published in English, but the COVID-19 resource library contains documents in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai.\n',

      "This policy addresses institutional policies, practices, and procedures for ensuring dual use research of concern (DURC) are properly identified and any risks are appropriately mitigated at institutions.

The policy delineates the roles and responsibilities of funding agencies, research institutions, and life scientists in ensuring that the new requirements are adhered to.",
    Long_description:
      'The United States Government (USG) Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern defines the practices and procedures required by the US government to ensure comprehensive identification and oversight of dual use research of concern (DURC) at the institutional level. The policy defines DURCE as any life sciences research that can be reasonably anticipated to result in knowledge, information, products, or technology that could be misapplied to pose a significant threat to public health and safety, agricultural crops, and other plants, animals, the environment, or national security. This policy is just one of several regulations that the United States Government has published relevant to dual use research of concern. This policy is a companion to a 2012 policy, _Policy for Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern_ _(March 2012 DURC Policy). _That 2012 policy established a USG process for regular review of USG-funded or -conducted research with certain high-consequence pathogens or toxins. Together the two policies establish a comprehensive DURC oversight system that involves both the US government, private research funders, and research institutions.\n\nThis policy was enacted by the United States government. The United States government is composed of a legislative, judicial, and executive branch. The executive branch contains several cabinet-level executive branch departments, including the United States Department of Human Services (HHS). HHS publishes policies on dual use research of concern and other issues relevant to biosecurity. Policies enacted by the US government apply to all 50 states, even though state’s also have their own legislative, judicial, and executive bodies. More information about this policy and other policies related to DURC can be found on the US Government Science Safety and Security website (link included as documentation). This document may be useful for both institutions seeking to comply with relevant US research policy, and legislative leaders interested in establishing a national DURC oversight system. Currently, the policies are only available in English and no updates to the legislation are anticipated.\n',

      'In compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science requested that the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) provide advice for creating a code of conduct for biosecurity. The resulting code of conduct details rules aimed at preventing the misuse of life sciences research. These rules apply to a variety of roles and organizations, and organizations may tailor the implementation of those rules to best fit their institution.',
    Long_description:
      'This document contains a national code of conduct on biosecurity as well as background and explanation for the text of the code of conduct. The code of conduct is intended to prevent the misuse of biological agents and toxins. It specifically aims to prevent the development, production, or stockpiling of biological weapons. The code of conduct is aimed at institutions, organizations, and professionals currently working in the life sciences. \n\nThe sixth Biological Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 2006 emphasized the importance of raising awareness around dual use research and establishing a national biosecurity code of conduct for scientists to prevent the misuse of this research. The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science asked the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) to develop such a code of conduct. KNAW advises the Dutch government on issues related to science and literature. KNAW is also the InterAcademy Panel’s ‘lead academy’ for all issues related to biosecurity. To create this document, KNAW assembled a working group to study how to implement a national biosecurity code of conduct, with a focus on how similar measures had been implemented at the national and institutional level. As of September 2021, the document is only available in English and no further updates have been published.\n',

    Short_description:
      'This guidance informs nations about the risks posed by the accidental or deliberate misuse of life sciences research and proposes measures to minimize these risks. It seeks to provide support to WHO member states to assess healthy security strengths and weaknesses, identify priority areas for promoting responsible research practices, and to provide technical expertise and training. Policymakers, health researchers, laboratory managers, and research institutions can then decide which of these measures are most appropriate and relevant to their national circumstances.',
    Long_description:
      'This guide proposes measures to prevent the deliberate misuse of life sciences research and to effectively harness life sciences research to public health. The authors propose that there are three essential pillars of biorisk management and public health: research excellence; ethics; and laboratory biosafety and biosecurity. The document also includes a self-assessment questionnaire to aid public health and life sciences practitioners in assessing how well the three pillars have been implemented within their own institution.\n\nThe WHO is the agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. The agency has 194 member states. Its mission is to promote the right to health and well-being for all people, as stipulated in its 1948 constitution. The agency also leads and coordinates the international response to health emergencies. The 194 member states may propose health policy annually at the World Health Assembly (WHA), the governing body of the WHO. This guidance contributes to the implementation of World Health Assembly Resolution 55.16, which urged the World Health Organization (WHO) member states to prepare for the possibility of a deliberately caused disease outbreak and to strengthen public health surveillance and response activities to prevent any deliberate or accidental disease outbreaks. While this guide may be of interest to a large audience, the WHO intended for this document to primarily be used by researchers and laboratory managers. The self-assessment questionnaire may also be of use to health policymakers.\n',

      'These training materials include instructions for running a variety of immersive, interactive activities designed to teach participants the practical applications of laboratory biosafety and biosecurity concepts. Experts from Gryphon Scientific, Moroccan Biosafety Association, Batna University I, American University of Beirut, and Royal Scientific Society of Jordan produced these training materials as part of a train-the-trainer event. These materials are intended for any person attempting to teach colleagues and students about laboratory biosafety and biosecurity.',
    Long_description:
      'These training materials were created by a group of biosecurity experts for a “train the trainer” event that taught participants new approaches for biosecurity education. The experts intended that the training materials both train participants to consider practical applications of laboratory biosecurity and biosafety and demonstrate an active learning approach to biosecurity education. The experts also hoped that the training materials would address and build upon existing gaps in biosecurity research, governance, and training. The training materials include mock review scenarios, table top exercises, a sticky note exercise, and an interactive computer game.\n\nThe expert group that produced the training event was composed of individuals from Gryphon Scientific, Moroccan Biosafety Association (MOBSA), Batna University I, American University of Beirut, and Royal Scientific Society of Jordan. MOBSA is an NGO that promotes biosafety as a scientific and academic discipline. Gryphon Scientific is a private business that provides expertise in the life sciences and public health to a variety of clients, including many US government agencies.

    Short_description:
      'This guide describes the legal and ethical obligations that researchers have to handle issues related to dual-use and to prevent the potential misuse of research. The guide includes common definitions, institutional obligations, links to relevant resources, etc. It is aimed at researchers operating within the European Union.',
    Long_description:
      'This brochure outlines the legal and ethical obligations of researchers to prevent the malevolent use of dual use research. The document includes definitions of misuse and dual use research as well as examples of common cases of the two. The discussion of researchers’ legal obligations and relevant regulations assumes that those researchers are working within the European Union. Therefore, this document will be most relevant to researchers in the EU. \n\n This brochure is the result of a collaboration between five Flemish universities and the Working Group Dual Use of the Flemish Interuniversity Council. Two outside research organizations, Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (imec) and the Flanders Institute of Biotechnology (VIB), participated in the brochure’s development as well. The Flemish Interuniversity council was founded in 1976 to promote cooperation and understanding between Belgium’s universities. The council operates as a think tank and provides guidance to institutions on a wide range of topics including research management and academic governance. The Flanders Institute of Biotechnology is a Flemish institution dedicated to strengthening life sciences research in Belgium and transforming that research into economic growth. Imec is an international research organization that merged with the Flemish digital research center iMinds in September 2016. \n\n\n',

    Short_description:
      "This guide contains a set of tools designed for institutions, principal investigators, and institutional review entities implementing the United State's review procedures and oversight requirements for life sciences research (i.e. Policy for Institutional DURC Oversight). These procedures apply to any life sciences research that is either being funded by the U.S. government or conducted at an institution that receives federal funding. The guide covers the entire institutional review process and sections of it are intended for different audiences depending on who is involved at that stage of the process.",
    Long_description:
      'This guide describes how to implement and comply with relevant US government (USG) policy on the oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). The guide focuses specifically on two policies, _The USG Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern_ (_Policy for Institutional DURC Oversight_) and _the USG Policy for Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern_ (_March 2012 DURC Policy_). These policies apply to the oversight of any DURC that is either funded by the US government or occurs at an institution that receives funding from the US government. The guide is specifically intended for researchers and institutions who are subject to those policies, but the recommendations on dual use oversight may still be useful for members of the life sciences community that are not subject to the US DURC policies.\n\nThis guide was prepared by the United States National Institutes of Health (US NIH). The US NIH is the US government’s biomedical and public health research agency. The NIH operates within the US Department of Health and Human Services (US HHS), the branch of the US federal government charged with safeguarding the health of Americans. In addition to the companion guide, HHS has developed and published several other documents, including case studies, frequently asked questions, training slides, a brochure, and an educational poster, to help researchers and institutions comply with DURC oversight policies. Some of those resources were added following a 2015 Stakeholder Workshop. The companion guide has not been updated since September 2014. As of September 2021, all of the resources, including the companion guide, are only available in English. \n',

    Short_description:
      'This regulation outlines a series of export controls for dual-use items. This common control system and set of policies are intended to ensure the safe and free movement of dual-use items inside the European Union. It is the responsibility of the EU member states to give competent authorities the power to ensure that these regulations are complied with.',
    Long_description:
      'This regulation aims to establish a European Union (EU) system for controlling the export, transfer, transportation, and brokering of dual-use items. Dual-use items are defined in the document as any goods and technology that have both a civilian and military use or any item that may assist in the manufacturing of nuclear weapons or devices. As part of this regulation, the Council establishes a common list of dual use items. These items are then subject to certain regulations within the EU and an official export authorization is required to export these items from the EU to a non-EU country. This regulation also establishes a network of competent export control authorities organized and led by the Dual-Use Coordination Group. The Dual-Use Coordination Group is tasked with exchanging information on export controls and developing tools to support implementation of aforementioned controls. The intention of this regulatory system is to ensure that the EU complies with its international obligations and agreements, especially those regarding non-proliferation.\n\nThe Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the European Union. The Council and the European Parliament negotiate and adopt EU laws as well as the EU budget, based on proposals generated by the European Commission. The Council also coordinates policies for EU member states, develops the EU’s foreign and security policy, and negotiates agreements between the EU and other groups. The Council of the EU has no fixed members and instead meets in 10 different configurations depending on the policy area being discussed. Configurations are composed of government ministers with expertise in the area of discussion from each of the EU member states. This regulation, like all EU legislative texts, is available in the official languages of the EU member states (excluding Irish for resource-related reasons). This act is still in force but it has been amended since its initial publication. All amendments can be found on the Council of the EU website. \n\n\n',

      "The online facilitators' manual describes the structure of the Biosafety, Biosecurity, and the Evaluation of Biohazards Course and contains links to the accompanying lecture presentations, student readings, exercises, and assignments. The course is designed to provide an overview of biological safety for students at all levels with an interest or previous background in microbiology and specifically the epidemiology of microbial diseases. Instructors may adapt the course to best suit their needs and audience.",
    Long_description:
      "This resource includes a facilitator's manual, Powerpoint lectures, student readings, exercises, and assignments. The facilitator’s manual is available both as a PDF and as an online tool. This course provides an overview of the field of biological safety and its application for students and epidemiologists. The course is geared towards students who may handle hazardous biological materials, graduate students considering biosafety as a profession, and public health professionals who are interested in exploring biohazards. It was initially taught by a biosafety officer, but the course guide stipulates that professionals from a variety of different fields may serve as course instructors or provide assistance with the course. Instructors may be members of the university’s microbiology department, the institution’s biological safety committee, the local public health department, animal resource center, or first responder services. The course may be modified as necessary to suit the instructor or student needs.\n\nThis guide is based on the Yale School of Public Health’s semester-long Biosafety class. The Yale School of Public Health is home to one of the oldest public health masters programs in the United States and consistently ranks as one of the best schools for public health in the United States. The course was created by Ben Fontes, who has been a Biosafety Officer at Yale University since 1995. Currently, the course materials are only available in English. There are no planned updates to this course at this time.\n\n\n",

      'This 5-minute video provides a basic explanation of each of the Netherlands Biosecurity Office’s eight pillars of biosecurity: awareness, personnel reliability, transport security, information security, accountability for materials, response, management, and physical measures. This video is focused on members of organizations who work with high risk biological materials. \n\nIn 2009, the Dutch government initiated a coordinated Biosecurity Program to assist organizations that handle potentially hazardous biological agents and any associated technology. The Netherlands Biosecurity Office was founded in 2012 as a part of that program. \nThe Biosecurity Office is the Dutch knowledge and information center for biosecurity. It offers a plethora of awareness-raising online tools and in-person workshops. In creating these resources, the Biosecurity Office refers to previously adopted practices set forth by national and international initiatives, including the BTWC, the EU CBRN Action Plan, CWA 15793, and the Dutch Biosecurity Code of Conduct. A Dutch version of the video is available with Dutch subtitles. An English version of the video is also available with Russian subtitles. A plain-text description of the video is provided in both English and Dutch. \n\n\n',

      'This guide describes how nations can implement a "National Biosecurity Regime" that controls access to potentially dangerous biological agents and ensures that corresponding facilities handle those agents appropriately. The objective of this regime at the national level is protect people, property, institutions, and the environment from illegal biological attacks. These recommendations can help legislative leaders prevent, prepare for, and respond to such attacks.',
    Long_description:
      'This document contains recommendations for countries seeking to implement national biosecurity regimes. In 2008, the European Council approved conclusions intended to prevent the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Following those conclusions, each European Union Member State committed to adopting new regulations to prevent the use of biological agents as weapons. The first set of recommendations focuses on combating potential biological attacks at the national level. The second set of recommendations deals with the handling, storage, and transportation of potentially hazardous biological materials at the facility level. The recommendations are based on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and UN Resolution 1540.\n\nThis set of recommendations was authored by the Spanish government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the branch of the Spanish Government responsible for overseeing the nation’s foreign policy and promoting international cooperation on policy issues. The resource was originally published in Spanish, but an English translation is available. This guide may be useful for national legislative leaders seeking to implement a comprehensive biosecurity regime, especially those based in an EU member state. No updates are planned at this time.\n',

However, these questionnaires have shorter questions, and responses are limited to “Yes,” “No,” or “N.A.”\n\nIn 2009, the Dutch government initiated a coordinated Biosecurity Program to assist organizations that handle potentially hazardous biological agents and any associated technology. The Netherlands Biosecurity Office was founded in 2012 as a part of that program. \nThe Biosecurity Office is the Dutch knowledge and information center for biosecurity. It offers a plethora of awareness-raising online tools and in-person workshops. In creating these resources, the Biosecurity Office refers to previously adopted practices set forth by national and international initiatives, including the BTWC, the EU CBRN Action Plan, CWA 15793, and the Dutch Biosecurity Code of Conduct. The self-scan toolkit is just one of the online tools available on the Biosecurity Office’s website. This particular tool is available in English, Dutch, and French. No updates are expected at this time. This tool aims to strengthen awareness around biosecurity among laboratory employees, biosafety or biosecurity officers, and laboratory managers.\n\n\n',

      'The Laboratory design and maintenance Monograph covers laboratory design and maintenance, the process of building, renovating or repurposing a laboratory. This monograph describes design considerations for different types of lab facilities and is targeted to the wide range of people, including construction engineers and architects, that would be involved in the lab design process. This monograph was written with the understanding that lab construction is an infrequent event, and care must be taken so that  lab facilities can remain functional throughout the decades that the laboratory is in use. This monograph is designed to be used with the Risk Assessment Monograph, and gives advice on how to construct facilities if it is determined that heightened control or maximum containment measures are needed. The monograph also covers how to safely decommission a laboratory. The creation of this monograph was funded by Global Affairs Canada, the United States Department of State and the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency.\n\nThis monograph was one of seven associated with the 4th edition of the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual (LBM). The LBM guidelines were mentioned by almost every expert that we interviewed for this library, and have been fundamental to laboratory biosafety since the first edition was released in 1983. While the standards outlined in this manual are not legally binding, they have become the defacto global standard for biosafety and have inspired many national codes. These guidelines are developed with experts from around the world, and were most recently updated for the fourth edition in 2020, which places a larger emphasis on an evidence and risk based approach to biosafety and biosecurity. Previous editions of the manual have been published in 13 languages, although, as of the last time this library was updated, the 4th edition was only available in English. The development of the manual is led by the Biosecurity and Health Security Interface at the WHO, a team who also supports national implementation efforts of the International Health Regulations and emergency preparedness. \n',

      'The Personal protective equipment Monograph covers personal protective equipment (PPE), items worn to protect lab personnel from exposure to lab hazards, such as chemicals and biological material. This monograph describes the different types of PPE and which are needed during different lab activities of varying risk. A risk assessment for laboratory activities is also included in this monograph. The monograph covers PPE that protects the body, eyes and face, feet, hands, the respiratory system, and hearing. It also covers how to put on, remove and dispose of PPE properly. The creation of this monograph was funded by Global Affairs Canada, the United States Department of State and the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency.\n\nThis monograph was one of seven associated with the 4th edition of the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual (LBM). The LBM guidelines were mentioned by almost every expert that we interviewed for this library, and have been fundamental to laboratory biosafety since the first edition was released in 1983. While the standards outlined in this manual are not legally binding, they have become the defacto global standard for biosafety and have inspired many national codes. These guidelines are developed with experts from around the world, and were most recently updated for the fourth edition in 2020, which places a larger emphasis on an evidence and risk based approach to biosafety and biosecurity. Previous editions of the manual have been published in 13 languages, although, as of the last time this library was updated, the 4th edition was only available in English. The development of the manual is led by the Biosecurtity and Health Security Interface at the WHO, a team who also supports national implementation efforts of the International Health Regulations and emergency preparedness. \n\n\n',

      'In this report, the United States National Science Advisory Board (US NSABB) identifies key principles, features, and implementation steps of effective oversight of dual-use life science research at both the federal and local levels. The recommendations are intended as guidelines but rather as a framework for the development of a comprehensive oversight system by the federal government. This report may be of particular interest to those stakeholders implementing or improving upon the oversight of dual use research.',
    Long_description:
      'This document contains recommendations for the governmental oversight of publicly funded life sciences research. These recommendations aim to minimize the possibility that this research and any resulting information, products, or technologies are misused for harmful purposes. Any life sciences research that has the potential for benevolent and malevolent applications is referred to in this document as “dual use research.” The phrase “dual use research of concern” refers to the subset of dual use research that has the most significant potential for malevolent applications. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity’s (NSABB’s) preliminary analysis of the amount of dual use research of concern cases in the US concluded that the misuse of dual use research of concern is a low probability but potentially high-consequence event.\n\nThe NSABB is a federal committee that advises the United States government on issues related to biosecurity and dual use research. The recommendations provided in this document are intended to serve as a framework for the US government to develop a comprehensive and coordinated oversight policy for dual use research. The proposed framework may be useful for other countries seeking to establish a national oversight framework for dual use research. As of September 2021, this document is only available in English and has no scheduled updates.\n',

    Short_description:
      'This booklet describes the multilateral treaties that apply to various aspects of synthetic biology, including the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The author also addresses potential gaps in the current governance and proposes new principles for a more holistic regulatory approach towards synthetic biology. This booklet may be useful for anyone curious about current international law surrounding synthetic biology.',
    Long_description:
      'This book in the Third World Network’s (TWN’s) Biotechnology and Biosafety Series explores international treaties with applications to synthetic biology. The book is divided into three chapters. The first discusses the relevance of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the associated Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) to synthetic biology. The second chapter focused on other international laws and agreements that may apply to synthetic biology, including the Biological Weapons Convention and the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). The second chapter also addresses gaps in the existing frameworks. In light of these gaps, the author proposes several principles and objectives for the regulation of synthetic biology. \n\nTWN is an international non-profit that focuses on issues relating to global development and North-South affairs. It was formed in 1984 to strengthen cooperation between development and environment groups in the global South. To encourage equitable and ecologically sustainable development in the global South, TWN conducts research, publishes books, and hosts conferences and workshops. Other publications in the TWN Biotechnology and Biosafety series focus on genetic engineering and other emerging biotechnologies. While No. 16 and No. 15 in the series are available in Spanish, this document is currently only available in English. It is the last publication in the series, and no further updates are expected. This book may be useful to regulators attempting to understand current international frameworks governing synthetic biology.\n\n\n',

    Short_description:
      "This book suggests effective ways to prepare for and mitigate both the immediate and longer-term consequences of a biological attack or accident. It draws on the Danish Centre for Biopreparedness and Biosecurity's (CBB) experience to suggest a model that other country's can use - either in whole or in part - to establish or improve upon their own biopreparedness systems. The book can be read cover-to-cover or used as a reference since it is seperated into smaller sections.",
    Long_description:
      'This guide describes effective ways to investigate and respond to accidents or terrorist attacks involving hazardous biological substances. It includes strategies for quickly responding to biological incidents, practical advice for implementing national biopreparedness systems, as well as an overview of relevant issues, including mass vaccination, quarantine, decontamination, international cooperation, and public communication. This 2019 guide has been written as a companion volume to the Danish Center for Biosecurity and Biopreparedness’ 2015 guide, _An Efficient and Practical Approach to Biosecurity_. The first volume is a comprehensive guide to establishing national biosecurity systems. The first book also addresses the issue of biopreparedness, but this volume expands on that discussion substantially. \n\nThe Danish Centre for Biosecurity and Biopreparedness (CBB) is Denmark’s national biosecurity authority. The center maintains a 24/7 response capability for responding to an accidental or malicious biological incident and is responsible for issuing institutional licenses for working with dual use biological research components. This guide is intended for decision-makers in public health and biosecurity as well as any person that might have a role in responding to a biological incident. For instance, members of the police, military, fire department, and other emergency response services may have important roles in the event of a bioterror attack, even if they do not deal with biological issues on a day-to-day basis. As of September 2021, this document is only available in English and has no scheduled updates.\n\n\n',

      "The OIE's World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) is a database dedicated to disseminating information about the animal health situation worldwide. The immediate notification reports, as well as the six-month and annual summary reports, can help interested parties learn more about relevant animal disease events. Each report will include the OIE-listed disease reported as well as the reason for the report, the date of the event start, the event status, and any control measures taken at the event level.",
    Long_description:
      'The OIE World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) has three main components: an early warning system, a monitoring system, and an annual reporting system. The early warning system publishes daily reports of animal disease events for all 117 OIE-listed diseases. The criteria for OIE list inclusion is detailed in the Terrestrial and Aquatic codes. The monitoring system consists of six-monthly reports that describe the OIE-listed diseases reported in each country/territory. Annual reports are also published for each country/territory. These annual reports contain additional information on the area’s animal population, potential zoonotic diseases, and veterinary capabilities. The OIE-WAHIS system can help users undertstand the animal health situation worldwide.\n\nOIE was established in 1924, has 182 member countries and is a leading global authority on animal health. OIE receives its mandate from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. All the information in OIE-WAHIS is reported by Veterinary Services of member countries and territories. If you would like access to the data entry portal of OIE-WAHIS, you can send a request for access to [wahis-support@oie.int](mailto:wahis-support@oie.int). You can also request information on annual reports or voluntary reports for non OIE-listed diseases by contacting information.dept@oie.int. This library includes an example of a OIE-WAHIS report. The report describes an avian influenza outbreak in Benin and includes general information, epidemiology, and control measures at the event level. Reports are available in French, English, and Spanish.\n\n\n',

    Short_description:
      'This handbook seeks to engage scientists, laboratory employees, and students in laboratory biosecurity and also provides practical advice regarding the secure handling, management, and storage of biological materials. Rather than just educating laboratory members on biosafety, this book seeks to raise awareness of biosecurity issues in the lab and how the life sciences can be maliciously used. The handbook is aimed at all personnel who work with infectious toxins and pathogens both in the private and public sector.',
    Long_description:
      'This handbook offers practical advice for securing potentially hazardous biological materials or sensitive information technology in the laboratory against unauthorized access, loss, theft, misuse, or intentional release. It also aims to engage scientists, laboratory employees, and life science students on the issue of laboratory biosecurity. Section 1 describes the purpose of the handbook. Section 2 of the handbook introduces the basic components of laboratory biosecurity, including biosecurity risk assessment, employee accountability, material control, information security, transport security, and physical security. These biosecurity components are relevant to all laboratory employees. Section 3 may be more relevant to laboratory managers and other people in positions of authority because it focuses on the laboratory supervisor’s role in safeguarding laboratory assets. This supervisory role involves reporting security breaches, managing personnel, and planning responses to breaches or incidents.\n\nStockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) was founded in 1966 to provide data, analysis, and recommendations on issues related to global security. The author is Dr. Peter Celevestig of the SIPRI Arms Control and Nonproliferation Program. Dr. Peter Celevestig is a virologist with experience working in the laboratories of Karolinska Institute (KI) and serving on the KI laboratories’ Biosafety Committee. SIPRI and the author identified a gap in current biosecurity publications and published this guide to address that gap. They observed that guidance on biosecurity was often presented at the national or international level and any discussion of biosecurity in the laboratory arose only when the issue was directly related to biosafety. This handbook may be useful for any laboratory employee or manager seeking to understand how biosecurity is relevant in a laboratory setting. As of September 2021, this document is only available in English and has no scheduled updates.\n',

    Short_description:
      'The 2012 National Biosecurity and Biosafety bill established a regulatory framework to faciliate the safe development and application of modern biotechnology. It also designated a national competent authority for setting standards and guidelines related to biosafety and biosecurity issues as well as several biosafety committees. The bill is still being debated within parliament but may provide a model for similar countries seeking to enact biosecurity and biosafety legislation.',
    Long_description:
      'This bill aims to establish a regulatory framework and institutions for the safe development and application of biotechnology, specifically in reference to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). The bill establishes a single competent national authority on issues of biosafety as well as national and institutional biosafety committees. The bill was introduced in 2012, and in March 2013, the Ugandan Committee on Science and Technology tabled the bill for public hearing. \n\nUganda ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1993 and subsequently ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) in 2001. The CPB required each party to the CBD to implement a national legal framework for the safe development and commercialization of GMOs or Living Modified Organisms (LMOs). Uganda introduced this bill to satisfy that requirement and also ensure that the country could safely continue to use emerging biotechnologies to modernize its agricultural system and enhance its industrialization efforts. The bill may be of interest to legislative leaders in other countries seeking to implement similar national legislation on biotechnology and biosafety, especially leaders in low to middle income countries. Additionally, the 2015 article “Public Submissions on the Uganda National Biotechnology and Biosafety Bill, 2012 Reveal Potential Way Forward for Uganda Legislators to Pass the Bill” in _Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology _may provide useful context for legislators particularly interested in the public discourse around this bill, although the article is not included in the library as of September 2021.\n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'The Risk Assessment Monograph covers risk assessment, the systematic process of evaluating the hazards of exposure and release of dangerous materials in a laboratory setting, and setting appropriate risk control measures. The monograph describes how to conduct a risk assessment using the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle that takes into account many factors, including the routes of transmission and exposure risks for biological agents, availability of treatment, disease severity, competency of lab personnel and the potential misuse of the biological agent for harm. The monograph provides both a short and long risk assessment template, as well as four examples of completed risk assessments. The creation of this monograph was funded by Global Affairs Canada, the United States Department of State and the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency.\n\nThis monograph was one of seven associated with the 4th edition of the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual (LBM). The LBM guidelines were mentioned by almost every expert that we interviewed for this library, and have been fundamental to laboratory biosafety since the first edition was released in 1983. While the standards outlined in this manual are not legally binding, they have become the defacto global standard for biosafety and have inspired many national codes. These guidelines are developed with experts from around the world, and were most recently updated for the fourth edition in 2020, which places a larger emphasis on an evidence and risk based approach to biosafety and biosecurity. Previous editions of the manual have been published in 13 languages, although, as of the last time this library was updated, the 4th edition was only available in English. The development of the manual is led by the Biosecurtity and Health Security Interface at the WHO, a team who also supports national implementation efforts of the International Health Regulations and emergency preparedness. \n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      "This report considers the findings of four workshops convened by the United States National Academy of Medicine during the summer of 2015. The workshops explored the potential for improving international management and response to a potential pandemic. Summaries of the four workshops can be found on the National Academy of Medicine’s website at <https://nam.edu/initiatives/global-health-risk-framework/>. The resulting report translates those findings into actionable recommendations. The report focuses on the role of pandemic preparedness in a country’s national security and economic stability and argues that mitigating future pandemics must then require the mobilization of several different sectors. Its recommendations specifically encompass three broad areas: reinforcing national public health capabilities; reinforcing international leadership and coordination for pandemic preparedness and response; accelerating research and development in the field of infectious diseases.\n\nThe National Academy of Medicine agreed to convene an independent, international group of experts in the wake of the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The resulting commission, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future, comprises 17 members from varying countries and academic backgrounds. The commission's goal is to provide recommendations for improving the international response to outbreaks of infectious disease. Several large nonprofits funded the commission, including the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, and many others. The commission published this report in 2016 and has not published any follow-up reports. The report is currently only available in English.\n\n\n",

      'Bridging Science and Security for Biological Research: A Dialogue between Universities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  is a meeting report that describes the third workshop in a series that was run jointly between the United States (US) FBI and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The goal of the workshops was to discuss how to increase communication between the US FBI and American universities so that the two groups could work together to reduce national security threats from biological research and to maintain the US competitive research advantage. Although this workshop was US focused, it is a good example of how to increase collaboration between academics and national security practitioners to mitigate risk. \n\nThe meetings took place throughout 2012 and 2013 under the FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate (WMDD). WMDD was created after September 11, 2001 to provide a cohesive and coordinated approach to countering WMD threats and responding to incidents if they occur. WMDD has a Biological Countermeasures Unit (BCU) that conducts extensive outreach to the life sciences community to proactively build mutually beneficial relationships and broaden scientists’ understanding of biosecurity concerns. The workshop was in collaboration with AAAS, a US-based science society that serves 262 affiliated societies and academies of science.\n\n\n',

      'This chapter argues that the concept of viral sovereignty did not originate when the Indonesian government refused to share its H5N1 virus samples with the World Health Organization in 2007 and that the PIP Framework legitimized viral sovereignty as a broader legal norm. The authors argue that this legal norm could delay life-saving efforts during epidemics and pandemics, and they urge the international community to consider solutions that will facilitate the sharing of virus samples. This chapter may be useful for members of the international community seeking to both learn more about virus sovereignty and encourage benefit-sharing between nations.',
    Long_description:
      "This article by Michelle F. Rourke critically analyzes the history of “viral sovereignty.” Viral sovereignty is the concept that virus samples isolated from within a state’s borders are the sovereign property of that state. Rourke argues that viral sovereignty as a concept did not begin with Indonesia’s 2007 decision to claim sovereignty over the H5N1 virus samples. Indonesia may have been the first nation to invoke the United Nation’s Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to claim sovereignty over virus samples, Rourke claims it was not the first country to deny the WHO access to influenza viruses.To resolve these issues, the WHO introduced the PIP framework, which encouraged the sharing of samples between countries. However, the author argues that the PIP Framework actually legitimized viral sovereignty as a legal norm by recognizing the sovereign rights of states over some pathogens. Rourke’s perspective may contradict traditional narratives since the term “sovereignty” has largely fallen out of use in the international biological community and the PIP Framework has received abundant praise.\n\nThis article may be useful for any one seeking to understand the PIP Framework’s impact on the international community. It was published in the 2020 in Infectious Diseases of the New Millenium. The author, Michelle F. Rourke, is a CSIRO Synthetic Biology Future Science Research Fellow at Griffith University’s Law Futures Centre where she researches the regulation of access to biological resources. She previously studied as a Fulbright Scholar at the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, Washington D.C.

    Long_description:
      'The Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) Global Health Security (GHS) Index is a comprehensive assessment of the health security capabilities of the 195 states that are party to the International Health Regulations (IHR). To create the GHS index, the project team collaborated with an international panel of 21 experts from 13 countries to create 140 questions that assess a country’s capability to prevent and mitigate epidemics. The questions are organized across six six core categories of preparedness: prevention; detection and reporting; rapid response; health system; compliance with international norms; and risk environment. The assessment relies on open source information that has been published by the country or by an international organization. Index scores for each country are displayed on the GHS Index map on the website. The team also published the index’s underlying data model and 33 recommendations for addressing gaps identified by the index in a PDF report. We have included that PDF report in this library.\n\nThe GHS index was primarily developed by the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security (JHU) with assistance from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). NTI is a non-profit, non-partisan organization founded in 2005. NTI works to prevent catastrophic attacks and accidents caused by weapons of mass destruction and disruption (WMDD). WMDD refers to nuclear, biological, radiological, chemical, and cyber weapons. NTI collaborates with presidents, prime ministers, scientists, and educators across the world to design threat-reduction projects. JHU is a non-profit organization within the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. JHU examines how scientific and technological innovations can improve health security. The EIU is the research branch of the Economist Group, the publisher of _the Economist_. The EIU’s network of more than 900 analysts and contributors conducts analysis of economic and development strategies. This index may be most useful for funders and officials seeking to identify and fill preparedness and capacity gaps at the international and national levels. The index is only available in English and no further updates are anticipated.\n',

    Short_description:
      "This sample act for national implementation of the BWC and Resolution 1540 allows countries to easily adapt this act to their own legislative context. It guides countries through choosing the correct legal mechanism, who should be the responsible authority, and which clauses of the act are nationally relevant. It's intended for policy-makers.",
    Long_description:
      'This “Sample Act” was developed to assist countries in drafting legislation to implement the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and the biological weapons-related provisions of UN Security Council 1540. The tool is freely available to legislative drafts, but drafters should take into consideration their country’s legal framework, level of biotechnological development, and any other relevant national circumstances. Part A of the act contains a brief introduction and definitions of relevant terms. Part B stipulates that non-State actors who misuse biological agents and toxins with the intent to harm or kill are committing an offence punishable by the law. Part C outlines a comprehensive system and biosecurity measures for preventing the proliferation of biological and toxin weapons. Part D outlines two proposed agencies for the enforcement and oversight of these measures. \n\nThis document is just one example of the Verification Research, Training and Information Center’s (VERTIC’s) many legislative drafting tools for implementing the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). VERTIC is an independent, non-profit based in central London that supports the development, implementation, and verification of international agreements and initiatives. VERTIC also provides regulatory guidelines, a model law, a legislative guide, and legislative instruments. This document is available in Arabic, Azeri, Bahasa Indonesian, English, French, Georgian, Mongolian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. VERTIC also provides a Civil Law version in French and Spanish. Several of the other tools are published in languages other than English as well.\n\n\n',

      'The Tianjin Biosecurity Guidelines for Codes of Conduct for Scientists are a set of 10 guiding principles for scientists to ensure that they are conducting research in a way that promotes biosecurity, responsible conduct, and development towards the sustainable development goals. These guidelines will be submitted to the 9th Review Conference of the BWC in the hopes of gaining international support. The 10 principles cover: 1. Ethical standards, 2. Laws and norms, 3. Responsible conduct of research, 4. Respect for research participants, 5. Research process management, 6. Education and training, 7. Research Finding Dissemination, 8. Public engagement on Science and Technology, 9. Role of institutions, 10. International cooperation. \n\nSince January 2021, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has worked with Tianjin University, the Interacademy Partnership, with support from the US Department of State and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to develop the guidelines. In July 2021, the Interacademy Partnership officially endorsed the guidelines. The guidelines were developed through two meetings of international experts from 16 different countries across 4 continents, held in April and May 2021. The guidelines are a good example of cross-regional collaboration, and were written to be applicable internationally. \n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'The World Health Organization (WHO) Biorisk Management: Laboratory biosecurity guidance was designed to help laboratory managers and national regulators strike a balance between traditional laboratory biosafety and broader laboratory biosecurity requirements. The guidelines were released in 2006 as a companion to Laboratory Biosafety Manual 3rd edition as a result of laboratory acquired SARS-CoV-1 infections in 2003-2004 in Singapore, Taipei and Beijing. The guidance builds upon the biorisk management framework outlined in LBM 3rd edition, and focuses more on laboratory biosecurity, in addition to biosafety. It also analyzes gaps in the current biosecurity system and proposes solutions. The target audience for the guidance is regulators, laboratory managers and laboratory personnel. \n\nThe guidance breaks down biorisk management into seven main components: 1. Use risk assessments to determine which biological materials need which level of protection, 2. Establish a clear chain of command, 3. Promote a culture of responsibility, 4. Balance security policy with research progress, 5. Strengthen collaboration between the scientific, technical and security sectors. 6. Provide appropriate training to employees of laboratory facilities. 7. Strengthen emergency response and recovery plans on the assumption that biorisk management systems can only minimize, but never really eliminate, every conceivable threat. Much of this guidance was expanded upon and incorporated into the LBM 4th edition. \n\n\n',

    Short_description:
      'This paper argues that organizations must foster an organizational culture of responsibility to ensure that biological risks are managed and life science research is conducted responsibly. To better understand how to foster such a culture, the authors reviewed over 4000 unique citations that discuss organizational culture and responsible conduct. The authors encourage further investigations into the effectiveness of training and interventions, and they recommend that life scientists draw from the substantial literature on security and conduct in similar areas.',
    Long_description:
      'This article draws upon the Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel’s (FESAP’s) 2014 recommendation to “strengthen a culture that emphasizes biosafety, laboratory biosecurity, and responsible conduct in the life sciences.” FESAP also called for semi-quantitative methods for evaluating the effectiveness of training, education, and codes of conduct on improving safety in research laboratories. FESAP provides guidance to the United States Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture and the Attorney General. \n\nDana Perkins, Kathleen Danskin, Elise Rowe, and Alicia A. Livinski, all members of the FESAP working group, authored the article. The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review of the current culture of biosafety, biosecurity, and responsible conduct in the literature, including metrics for evaluating organizational interventions intended to improve that culture.The authors identified three recurring themes: dual-use and/or biorisk management education and training; social responsibility in science, research ethics, and related education and training; and codes of conduct. The authors observe that there has been little assessment of the effectiveness of education and training interventions in the life sciences, but that there is a body of work discussing the effectiveness of Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training.The authors conclude that life scientists seeking to improve their organization’s culture of biosafety and biosecurity should draw on this RCR literature as well as analogous areas such as nuclear safety and security.\n\nThe article was published in 2019 in Applied Biosafety, the journal of ABSA International (ABSA). ABSA was founded in 1984 to promote biosafety as a scientific discipline, provide a professional association that represents the interests and needs of biosafety practitioners, and to provide a forum for biosafety information. As of September 2021, this article and Applied Biosafety are only available in English. This article may be useful for any one interested in strategies for evaluating and improving the culture of biosafety, biosecurity, and responsible research in their institutions.\n\n\n',

CEN has hosted 84 workshops as of September 2021. These workshops address emerging or rapidly evolving technologies that require quickly developed specifications and research. The main outcome of a CEN workshop is a CEN Workshop Agreement, a voluntary agreement with international applicability. The CEN workshop that produced this document commenced in December 2009, and representatives of interested parties drafted and approved the workshop agreement in June 2011. The National Members of CEN have endorsed the process of developing workshop agreements but cannot be held accountable for the agreement’s technical content. This workshop agreement is not an official, binding standard from the member organizations.\n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'The Viral Load Cascade Self-Assessment Scorecard is an assessment to score the strengths and weaknesses of national laboratories that do HIV viral load testing. This assessment was developed by the  Laboratory Systems Strengthening Community of Practice (LabCoP) of the African Society of laboratory Medicine (ASLM), a learning network, designed to link multidisciplinary teams from member countries to share laboratory experiences and best practices. Although the assessment is specific to HIV testing, it is a good example of capacity building and how to build regional specific guidance to support international guidance. \n\nLabCoP was launched in October 2017 and receives funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Over time, LabCoP has expanded its mandate from HIV testing to include COVID-19, waste management, monitoring, and evaluations. LabCoP provides a platform for fostering peer-to-peer exchange amongst laboratory personnel, clinicians, policy makers and communities, leveraging expertise across Africa and beyond. LabCoP is part of ASML, an independent, international, not-for-profit organisation founded in March 2011. ASML coordinates relevant stakeholders at the local, national, and international levels to improve local access to world-class diagnostic services. ASLM is the first pan-African society for laboratory professionals, endorsed by the African Union (AU) and supported by multiple African Ministers of Health.\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'On June 3-4, 2021, international experts from science research, industry, and academia convened in Malacca, Malaysia, for a Workshop on the Development of a National Code of Conduct for Biosecurity in the Framework of the Biological Weapons Convention. The workshop was hosted by Malaysia Ministry of Defence’s Science and Technology Research Institute for Defence (STRIDE) and Academy of Sciences Malaysia (ASM). The United States Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Cooperative Biological Engagement Programme (CBEP) helped organize the event. \n\nThis workshop provided a forum for presenting and discussing Malaysia’s draft of the National Code of Conduct for Biosecurity. A National Code of Conduct for Biosecurity can promote transparency around issues of misuse, enforce already existing standards, provide a set of ideals for practitioners, and define appropriate actions within broader professional and legal frameworks in response to concerns. Adopting a National Code of Conduct would also help Malaysia meet its nonproliferation obligation under the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC). More specifically, the workshop aimed to promote an awareness of dual use concerns, define professional and ethical behaviors that could be encouraged through a Code of Conduct, and help ensure a sense of ownership for Malaysia’s draft National Code of Conduct for Biosecurity amongst the life science community. The subsequent report, included here, provides an overview of every presentation at the workshop, breakout sessions, a draft code of conduct for biosecurity in the framework of the BWC, an outline of the draft’s main elements, and biographies of the main speakers. It is currently only available in English.\n\n\n',

      'The Chatham House Sustainable Laboratories Initiative Prior Assessment Tool was designed to support the laboratory development process in order to create critical infrastructure for disease surveillance and outbreak response. The tool allows for a structured conversation between funders and recipient countries on the best way to establish or repurpose laboratories in low-resource settings. The tool is authored by David Harper, Emma Ross and Benjamin Wakefield, in collaboration with West African partners, and funded by the Weapons Threat Reduction Program, Global Affairs Canada. \n\nThe tool emerged from a 2018 workshop in Abuja, Nigeria, where participants determined that there was a need to add more structure to conversations with funders, to have a more productive conversation about development in a low-resource setting. This tool is part of the sustainable laboratories initiative at the Chatham House Centre on Global Health security, which aims to help develop alternative approaches to biosafety and biosecurity in Africa, that are more reflective of local needs. Other efforts from the Centre include a case study of newly established laboratories in Lagos State and Nigeria, and a training hub for sustainable laboratories in Africa.\n',

At the request of the U.S. government, this guide is aimed at two non-traditional audiences: scientists trained in non-life sciences fields who nonetheless contribute to life science research and amateur biologists who pursue life science research as an avocation. The recommendations and observations are aimed at government officials or private sector groups conducting outreach and education efforts in these communities.',
    Long_description:
      'This report describes strategies for educating people engaged in biological research without formal life sciences training on potential areas of dual use concern. The report was published by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), a federal committee that advises the United States government on issues related to biosecurity and dual use research. The United States government charged the committee with developing strategies for promoting awareness of dual use issues amongst two non-traditional audiences, scientists who were not trained in the life sciences but nonetheless contribute to research in the field and amateur biologists. In the report, the committee makes a series of observations about these groups and then provides recommendations for outreach strategies based on those observations.\n\nOne of the interviewees mentioned the urgent need for dual use guidance for amateur biologists, noting that even a high schooler could create a potential dual use material with the amateur biology tools available today. We included this resource to fill that gap in guidance. This report may help teachers, trainers, and public officials develop strategies for raising awareness of dual use concerns amongst non-traditional audiences. While certain observations and strategies may be tailored to an American audience, the guide also includes observations about synthetic biology organizations with international reach, like DIYbio and International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM).\n\n\n',

The guide also covers basic laboratory biosafety, identifying biological agents that may be used in a bioterrorist attack, and packaging and shipping biological specimens safely. Some sections of the guide may only be relevant to laboratories within the United States. For instance, the guide covers relevant United States’ Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) regulations for working with bloodborne pathogens and rules for the United States’ Laboratory Response Network (LRN) Sentinel Level Clinical Laboratories. \n\nThe guide is co-published by the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). The APHL is an American membership organization that represents the laboratories tasked with protecting the health and safety of the public by monitoring issues related to food safety, environmental safety, and infectious diseases. It also works with over 30 other countries to strengthen laboratory practices. ASM is a professional organization for microbiologists with over 30,000 members, a global health program, and an academic journal. The two organizations recommend that this guide be stored in a location where laboratory staff can readily access a copy while working. They also recommend that any laboratorian who may encounter a biological agent be well-versed in the identification, referral, packaging, and shipping procedures outlined within the guide. The guide may be useful for organizations outside of the US seeking to produce a similar guide for their own laboratories. Although, the guide is currently only available in English.

      "The Report of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) during the COVID-19 response was the outcome of a September 2021 meeting, in which the WHO convened a group of 20 global experts to assess how the International Health Regulations (IHR) functioned during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The experts identified gaps in countries implementation of the IHR, which sets reporting and preparedness requirements for countries, as well as gaps in the IHR itself. Their 40 recommendations on how to improve the IHR to prevent the next public health emergency are outlined in this document. \n\nThis report comes out 10 years after the first Review Committee of the IHR reported on how the IHR functioned during the H1N1 public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in 2009-2010. The first report concluded that the world was ill prepared to respond to future PHEICs, and based on the committee's recommendations, subsequent public health efforts were directed towards strengthening health systems and building capacities at the national, regional and global levels to prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies. However, many of these systems were insufficient to combat COVID-19. This report reflects upon the shortcomings of global public health and proposes a path forward for integrating public health within the health sector and across the whole of government, so national and global systems can be brought together to combat new emerging threats. \n",

Project 81 is a three-year project funded by the European Union and led by Sustainable Criminal Justice Solutions Europe. The project is dedicated to improving biosecurity managements systems in South-East Asia and creating effective tools that enhance capabilities to respond to highly communicable diseases or global catastrophic events.',
    Long_description:
      'EU Project 81 aims to provide a set of recommendations for improving biosecurity management systems in South-East Asia as well as effective tools for enhancing the region’s capacity to respond to highly communicable diseases or catastrophic biological events, such as pandemics. This three-year project is funded by the European Union. The recommendations and tools are being developed on behalf of the European CBRN Centre of Excellence by a consortium of biosecurity organizations and experts. In fact, project activities are informed by experts at several biosecurity institutions whose resources are also in the library, including the Netherlands Biosecurity Office and VERTIC. \n\nProject 81 was mentioned during a discussion of resources for addressing regional needs in South-East Asia. It is being delivered in partnership with and supporting activities in Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The webinar series linked here is just one example of the resources provided by Project 81, and more resources will be published as the project continues. The recommendations may be helpful for low-to-middle income countries as well. The webinar on waste management and COVID-19 specifically addressed the issue of people scavenging landfills for recyclables and masks, which is primarily a concern in low and middle income countries.\n\n\n',

      'PSDSs are technical documents that describe the hazardous properties of a human pathogen and provide recommendations for work involving these agents in a laboratory setting. These documents have been produced by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) as educational and information resources for laboratory personnel working with infectious substances. The agency provides both an editable safety data sheet template and a risk assessment tool to help users classify pathogens in their inventory.',
    Long_description:
      'The Pathogen Safety Data Sheets (PSDS) are technical documents that outline the risks and necessary precautions needed to work with human pathogens in a laboratory setting. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has published close to 200 PSDS for educational and informational use by laboratory personnel. In addition to the PSDS library, PHAC makes available a PSDS Template that allows users to build their own safety sheets for the pathogens they are working with in their unique setting. A PSDS has nine sections: 1. Infections Agent, 2. Hazard Identification, 3. Dissemination, 4. Stability and Viability, 5. First Aid and Medical, 6. Laboratory Hazards, 7. Exposure Controls and Personal Protection, 8. Handling and Storage, 9. Regulatory and Other Information. \n\nTHe PSDS library is regularly updated with new hazards for pathogens, and new pathogens are added as they become more commonplace in laboratories. The library is available on the PHAC website and mobile app in English and French. PSDS is part of a larger suite of biosafety and biosecurity resources maintained by the Canadian Centre for Biosecurity in collaboration with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada and PHAC. The Centre has 4 offices that focus on biosecurity: 1. Office of Biosafety Programs and Planning (OBPP), 2. Office of Biosafety and Biocontainment Operations (OBBO) , 3. Office of Pathogen Security (OPS), 4. Office of Stakeholder Engagement and Regulatory Affairs (OSERA).\n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'The Responsible Life Sciences Research for Global Health Security tool has two parts: 1. A background document that gives context and guidance on risk in life science research for global health security, 2.  A self-assessment questionnaire on biorisk management. It covers the risk of both accidents and deliberate misuse, and proposes measures to mitigate risk. The tool is specifically targeted at laboratory managers and research institutions that have a public health focus, and is written to be country agnostic, so that each lab can apply the guidance in a way that makes sense in their national context. The framework outlined in this resource has three pillars: 1. Research excellence, 2. Ethics, 3. Biosafety and laboratory biosecurity. The third pillar may be of most interest to the users of this library, and covers topics such as existing biorisk management structures, reinforcing public health capacity, and investing in workforce training. \n\nThis tool was published in 2010 by the World Health Organization department on Global Alert and Response in collaboration with global experts, and was funded by Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Ford Foundation. This tool comes out of a 2006 WHO working group, and a related WHO workshop, on responsible life science research, at which the need for more bio risk assessment mechanisms was identified. The resource is available in English.\n',

      'The WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework establishes a system for the sharing of viruses with pandemic potential as well as for vaccines and other life-saving products during a pandemic. The framework was introduced after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic illustrated the need for the sharing of vaccines, antivirals, and other pandemic response supplies between Member states. It aims to strengthen the WHO global surveillance and response system (“WHO GISRIS”). \n\nWHO GISRIS acts as a global alert system for the emergence of influenza viruses with certain notable features, particularly pandemic potential. The system encompasses four types of institutions and laboratories: National Influenza Centres, WHO Collaborating Centres, WHO H5 Reference Laboratories, and Essential Regulatory Laboratories. All of those institutions are subject to certain guiding principles, which are included within this document. \n\nThe framework also includes a standard material transfer agreement that may be used whenever “PIP biological materials” are shared between laboratories. PIP biological materials include human clinical specimens, as well as virus isolates of, modified viruses prepared from, cDNA encompassing the coding region of, and RNA extracted from H5N1 and other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential. This agreement can help laboratory managers coordinate the safe sharing of biological materials. The outline of the PIP benefits sharing system will also help legislative leaders in Member States ensure their role in the sharing and receiving of materials to prepare for the next pandemic.\n\n',

    Short_description:
      "PVS Pathway is a voluntary evaluation of countries' veterinary service capacity. It exposes gaps in animal health systems that can then be prioritized for action by governments and funders and provides targeted support through the OIE Veterinary Legislation Support Program. PVS Pathway is coordinated by regional OIE offices and consists of 4 steps- Orientation, Evaluation, Planning and Targeted Support. ",
    Long_description:
      'The Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway is a national program that helps countries build and improve their veterinary service capacity. The PVS Pathway empowers countries by providing them with a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses using a globally consistent methodology based on international standards that can reveal gaps, inefficiencies and opportunities for innovation. The PVS Pathway is a voluntary, collaborative process that is meant to provide a 5-10 year action plan for countries. The PVS Pathway has four stages: orientation, evaluation, planning and targeted support. These stages are outlined in the PVS toolkit, and are designed to be repeated by countries over time to track progress. \n\nThe PVS Pathway has been continuously improved upon by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) since 2007. The PVS Pathway toolkit is in its seventh edition that was published in 2019. Over 140 countries have participated in the PVS Pathway process. The PVS Pathway evaluation is carried out by OIE certified experts. The OIE is an intergovernmental organization with 182 member countries. The organization is responsible for safeguarding and improving animal health worldwide. It is recognized as a reference organization by the World Trade Organization and maintains permanent relations with nearly 75 other international and regional organizations. The OIE champions a “One Health” approach to health security, which asserts that human and animal health are interdependent and that preventing diseases in animals is the most effective way to safeguard human health.\n\n',

    Short_description:
      'This guidance aims to support veterinary services, public health officials, and other partners in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a farmed animal population. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the susceptibility of some animal species to infection has led to people infecting susceptible animals and some animal species potentially becoming reservoirs of COVID-19. This guide can help animal keepers, government officials, private sector individuals, and members of the general public reduce the risk of spillove and farmed animal infection using a One Health approach.',
    Long_description:
      'This document offers non-prescriptive, high-level guidance for preventing the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed animal populations.  OIE decided to publish the guidance following surveillance findings in farmed mink populations which suggested the genetic/antigenetic drift of SARS-CoV-2 following the introduction of the virus to mink from humans. The guidance includes a risk assessment of species farmed for food and/or fur, with a focus on the risk of human to animal SARS-CoV-2 transmission, animal to human SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission between animals. OIE also emphasizes the importance of having a disease-specific and site-specific farm biosecurity plan. The guide sets out several best practices for farms to establish systems and practices for minimizing risks introduced by visitors, farmed animals, roaming animals, feed, waste, tools, and vehicles.\n\nThe OIE is an intergovernmental organization with 182 member countries. The organization is responsible for safeguarding and improving animal health worldwide. It is recognized as a reference organization by the World Trade Organization and maintains permanent relations with nearly 75 other international and regional organizations. The OIE champions a “One Health” approach to health security, which asserts that human and animal health are interdependent and preventing diseases in animals is the effective way to safeguard human health. This report reflects such an approach since it seeks to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 by preventing animals from becoming reservoirs of Sars-CoV-2 or new variants of the disease. It’s aimed at animal keepers, government officials, the private sector, and the general public, with a specific focus on veterinary services and public health officials. As of September 2021, this guide is only available in English, but many of OIE’s resources are available in French or Spanish as well.\n\n',

The biosecurity checklist for laboratory assessment and monitoring is based on Malaysian and Dutch expert opinions and national and international guidelines and regulations. The checklist covers management, biosecurity awareness, physical security, accountability for materials, information security, transport security, personnel reliability and emergency response. \n\nThe Biosecurity checklist is the outcome of two 3-day workshops conducted over the course of four months in 2018 in which Malaysia collaborated with The Netherlands. This bilateral engagement aimed to integrate biosecurity practices into Malaysia's national biorisk management programs.  The workshops were co-organized by The Science and Technology Research Institute for Defense (STRIDE) in Malaysia and the Implementation Support Unit (ISU) of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), and sponsored by the European Union (EU) and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Malaysia was one of the BWC States parties that was selected through the Extended Assistance Program offered by the EU to support the BWC. \n\n\n",

    Short_description:
      'These are guidelines are necessary to follow for any researchers working with recombinant DNA and receiving money from the NIH. The guidelines specify biosafety practices and containment principles for constructing and handling: (i) recombinant nucleic acid molecules, (ii) synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules, and (iii) cells, organisms, and viruses containing such molecules. The guidelines are expanded every few years to keep pace with modern technology. ',
    Long_description:
      'The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules outline standards that all research within the US, and/or that has been funded by the NIH, which uses synthetic or recombinant nucleic acids must abide by. The guidelines include lists of experiments that need approval by the NIH and an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). It also contains a risk assessment for various biological agents and dictates the roles and responsibilities of all groups along the research pipeline, including the research institution, the principal investigator, and the NIH itself. Although the guidelines are specific to the US, the biosafety practices and containment principles for researchers doing nucleic acid research are applicable worldwide. \n\nThe guidelines were first published in 1976, as a direct output of the Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA. The guidelines are expanded every few years, and are currently on their 6th edition, which was published in 2019. The guidelines are published by the ​​Biosafety Policy and Recombinant DNA Policy Program at the NIH Office of Science Policy, who in addition to publishing biosafety guidelines, also run an advisory committee that assess the biosafety risk of emerging biotechnologies. The NIH Office of Science Policy also has divisions that focus on biosecurity, dual use research and data sharing. The guidelines are available in English \n\n\n',

      'The National and Regional Strategies to Strengthen Legislation on Biosafety and Biosecurity in Central Asia Report has 4 topics for each of the 7 Central Asian countries in the report: 1. A summary of the current state of biosafety and legislation. 2. Advice on how to proceed with legal drafting, 3. A strategy for inter-agency cooperation on biosafety and biosecurity, and 4. A proposed action plan for how to implement the suggested strategies. The 7 countries in the report are Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The report was prepared by Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC), which is based in the UK and works on all types of verification schemes for international agreements, under European Union Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Risk Mitigation Centres of Excellence Initiative (EU CBRN CoE) Project 53. \n\nProject 53 is a project focused on improving biosafety and biosecurity in Central Asia specifically, due the regions increased risk for epidemics and pandemics. The project aims to raise awareness of biosafety and biosecurity at the national and regional level, increase regional cooperation on relevant issues, and to help with workforce development through specialized training, and to make sure that the region is fulfilling their international obligations in this field. This report, published in 2019, is the first of seven work packages in the project, and was prepared using legislation surveys, national and regional workshops and direct country feedback. This report could be used as a case study for using this methodology in other regions with similar concerns. The report is published in English and Russian. \n',

    Long_description:
      'Mapping Maximum Biological Containment Labs Globally is an effort to increase public awareness about biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratories around the world. The report on the effort provides a map of BSL4 laboratories that are planned, under construction, and in operation, and identifies ways to measure the biosafety and biosecurity practices in the countries containing BSL4 laboratories. The report identified 59 maximum containment facilities, 36 of which are government run public health institutions. The report also draws attention to the fact that very few of the countries with laboratories have robust biosafety and biosecurity standards or dual use policies, and none have signed onto ISO 35001, a 2019 biorisk management standard. The report concludes with 5 key recommendations for increasing the safety and security of BSL4 laboratories. \n\nThe report was published by Global Biolabs, a collaboration between Gregory Koblentz at George Mason University and Filippa Lentzos at King’s College London. In addition to the report on the current state of BSL4 laboratories, Global Biolabs is engaged in advocacy for better international standards for biosafety and biosecurity, and have provided expertise at international meetings, such as the BWC meeting of experts in August 2021.  \n\n\n',

The guidance describes a whole-of-government approach that also engages external partners. It outlines strategies that can be used to improve the readiness and operational capabilities of government agencies and other stakeholders.",
    Long_description:
      'The National Health Security Strategy assesses the current and future health security environment in the United States. The 2019-2022 NHSS is focused on preparing the entire US government to respond in the event of a disaster, protect the nation from health threats, and foster partnerships between the government and the private sector on security issues. This strategy is accompanied by the 2019-2022 Implementation Plan (IP), which provides a roadmap for improving health security capabilities, and the 2015-2018 Evaluation of Progress (EOP), which assesses the nation’s progress in relation to current health security goals. The 2019-2022 NHSS is divided into two sections: an overview of the strategic environment and threat landscape and a strategic approach to those challenges. The strategy has been developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe NHSS is a key driver of the national implementation of public health and health security policy in the United States. It informs capacity-building programs in several American programs including the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) program, the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), and the U.S. Health Security National Action Plan. Furthermore, it seeks to engage the whole health security community to ensure that its objectives are met. Therefore, this resource may be informative for members of the U.S. and serve as an example of a strategy for a whole-of-government approach to health security. The NHSS is updated every four years and is currently only available in English. HHS’s continued development and release of a national health security strategy is a requirement of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act.\n\n',

      'The Legislative Analysis Tool is designed to help countries review existing legislation so that they can examine which additional measures need to be put in place to fulfill their obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and other related international agreements, and to ensure that any new legislation fits within their existing legal framework. The Tool contains a legislative survey template that identifies 137 measures that are relevant to the implementation of the BWC, and a survey overview template that provides a place to summarize key findings and recommendations from the legislative survey. The survey was created by Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC) in 2008, underwent major revisions in 2020, and was made publicly available in 2021. Although the surveys can now be done independently, the VERTIC team is available to review and analyze the results at a state’s request. The templates are currently only published in English, but VERTIC plans to release them in Arabic, Russian, French and Spanish in the near future.\n\nVERTIC is based in the UK and works on all types of verification schemes for international agreements. VERTIC has three main programs: 1. Verification and Monitoring, 2. National Implementation Measures, 3. Compliance Mechanisms and Measures. This tool is under the national implementation program for the BWC. Under the Implementing the Biological Weapons Convention program there are several tools: International Agreements, Legislative Assistance Provider, Legislation Drafting Tools, Legislation Drafting Assistant, BWC Legislation Database, Universality of the BWC, National Implementation Measures, and Fact Sheets. Many of these tools have their own entries in this library.\n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'The Laboratory Mapping Tool (LMT) is a standardized, spreadsheet-based assessment of veterinary laboratories that is designed to be used in any region throughout the world. It was developed to support national, regional and global efforts to maintain a robust network of animal health laboratories. The LMT assesses five areas: 1. General laboratory profile, 2.  Infrastructure, equipment and supplies, 3. Performance, 4. Quality assurance, biosafety and biosecurity, and 5. collaboration and networking. The safety and biosecurity module of the LMT (LMT-S) includes 98 measures derived from the OIE Terrestrial Manual, which has its own entry in this library, covering administrative, operational, engineering, and personal protective equipment practices. Each of these measures are rated on a four-point scale to generate an overall score, and data collected throughout the assessment is used to generate graphs and tables mapping levels of laboratory compliance with international standards and good practice. The LMT can be redone on an annual basis to monitor laboratory scores over time.\n\nThe LMT was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2010 and was first released publicly in 2014. From 2015 to 2017, the LMT-S was used to audit 34 laboratories in 19 countries. As of 2017, the LMT was available in English, French and Thai, but translation to other languages is available upon request. The LMT was originally developed as part of the IDENTIFY project, a 5-year project sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) that aimed at strengthening international laboratory capacity for disease surveillance and response. \n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      "The World Health Organization's (WHO) Laboratory Biosafety Manual (LBM) informs best practices for safely handling pathogenic biological agents in laboratories. Although the fourth edition of the LBM was published in 2020, some experts continue to rely on the third edition that was published in 2004. This continued reliance is due in part to the fact that the third edition is published in 13 languages, while the fourth edition is currently only available in English, and also due to the fact that it takes time to retrain personnel with the updated version. The third edition focuses largely on personal responsibility of laboratory personnel, while the fourth edition places a larger emphasis on an evidence and risk based approach to biosafety and biosecurity.\n\nThese guidelines were mentioned by almost every expert that we interviewed for this library, and have been fundamental to laboratory biosafety since the first edition was released in 1983. While the standards outlined in this manual are not legally binding, they have become the defacto global standard for biosafety and have inspired many national codes. These guidelines are developed with experts from around the world. \n\n",

      "The Laboratory Assessment Tool is a guidance document for laboratory assessment at the individual lab level and national laboratory systems. The tool is mainly focused on diagnostic laboratories and networks of labs that provide clinical care services or do disease surveillance. The assessment is in the form of a questionnaire that is available as PDF or as an Excel file with built in calculation of module criteria. The tool also comes with a guide document that walks users through the assessment process. The tool is specifically targeted at laboratory managers, national legislative leaders and NGOs, and is written to be country agnostic, so that each lab can apply the guidance in a way that makes sense in their national context. \n\nThis tool was published in 2012 by the World Health Organization in collaboration with global experts. The tool was designed to help support the International Health Regulations (IHR), which require WHO Member states to build national capacity to conduct surveillance and early disease detection capability. A strong laboratory network is crucial to proper public health infrastructure and this framework provides a standardized approach for assessing a system's capabilities. The tool is available in English, French, Spanish, and Russian. \n",

      'The Joint External Evaluation (JEE) is a framework for monitoring a country’s capacity under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR). The JEE is a voluntary and collaborative process that assesses countries within the IHR framework to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats, whether they are natural, accidental, or deliberate. The JEE is designed to expose a country’s shortcomings so that they can prioritize developing their public health infrastructure to close the most critical gaps. The JEE process consists of a self evaluation and external evaluation by experts in other countries and WHO, OIE and FAO staff. At the end of the JEE process, countries are given a score which serves as their baseline for improvement.\n\nOriginally, IHR implementation was measured exclusively from self evaluation by countries; in 2015, the World Health Assembly recommended that a peer review process be added to the self evaluation, and the two components together make up the JEE process. The JEE was developed to support related efforts such as the World Organization for Animal Health’s (OIE’s)\nPerformance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway, the Global Health Security Agenda and the World Bank Group. The JEE promotes transparency and mutual accountability, thereforeJEE scores and reports are made publically available upon completion.\n\n',

      'The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 15190: Medical laboratories — Requirements for safety outlines specific requirements for safe practices in medical laboratories.  The Standards specify requirements for setting the roles and responsibilities of a laboratory safety officer, who in turn is in charge of making sure employees are empowered to take personal responsibility over the safety of themselves and others in the laboratory. The first edition was published in 2003, and the second and most current edition was published in 2020.\n\nISO 15190 was developed by the ISO technical committee 212: Clinical laboratory testing and in vitro diagnostic test systems, which was composed of global experts from the field. ISO 15190 is part of the ISO 11.100.01: Laboratory Medicine in General set of standards, which contains other laboratory standards, such as ISO 15189: Medical laboratories — Requirements for quality and competence. ISO also links this document with Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well Being. The Standard is available for purchase through ISO, and is published in English. The ISO is an independent, non-governmental association of 166 national standards bodies from around the world. Each of their members helps contribute to creating international standards across many fields and then aids in disseminating and implementing the standards in their own countries. \n\n\n',

      'The International Health Regulations (IHR) are an international agreement that aims to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health mechanism for response to the international spread of disease in ways that enact the appropriate level of reaction based on the risks posed by the disease at hand, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. The IHR were first published in 1969 by the World Health Organization (WHO); the 3rd, and also most recent, edition was written in 2005 and came into effect in 2007. The IHR are legally binding for 194 countries, and require States to notify the WHO about any event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. They are written in a broad way to cover many different types of public health threats. The IHR also requires countries to set up national legislation and surveillance networks to legally and scientifically be able to track and respond to public health emergencies. \n\nThe IHR also establishes the criteria for the WHO to designate an event as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and allows the WHO to coordinate States’ response to the event. There have been six PHEICs since 2007, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The IHR maintains an Expert Roster that can be called upon by the WHO Director General for advice on declaring PHEICs or other public health emergencies. Countries are required to designate a National IHR Focal Point that is available around the clock to notify, consult and coordinate with the WHO on their IHR responsibilities. Compliance with the IHR is measured through the Joint External Evaluation (JEE). \n\n',

      'The Guidelines for Responsible Conduct in Veterinary Research are designed to raise awareness of the possibility of unintended consequences and misuse of veterinary research, and aims to support researchers and veterinary professionals in identifying and managing these dual-use implications of their work while not hindering their scientific progress. The Guidelines are not prescriptive, but rather help veterinary institutions create their own dual-use guidelines and review boards. The Guidelines walk through the risk review process throughout the research pipeline, and advocate for risk assessment of the research proposal by both a reviewing body and the funders, as well as a risk assessment of the research, analysis and publication of results. The Guidelines bring researchers, institutions, grant funders, contractors, companies, educators, publishers and regulators into the risk review process and outline how each group is responsible for parts of the pipeline.  \n\nThe Guidelines were published in 2019 by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as part of a larger biothreat reduction strategy, and are available in English. The OIE is an intergovernmental organization with 182 member countries. The organization is responsible for safeguarding and improving animal health worldwide. It is recognized as a reference organization by the World Trade Organization and maintains permanent relations with nearly 75 other international and regional organizations. The OIE champions a “One Health” approach to health security, which asserts that human and animal health are interdependent and that preventing diseases in animals is the most effective way to safeguard human health.\n\n\n',

The CBMs continued to be elaborated upon, modified, and expanded at future review conferences. The Seventh Review Conference in 2011 introduced revised reporting forms for the submission and distribution of the CBMs. While the CBMs are not mentioned in the text of the original BWC, all State Parties to the Convention are required to participate in the CBMs.\n\nThe “Guide to Participating in the Confidence-Building Measures of the Biological Weapons Convention” explains necessary background information, general advice, and detailed guidance on participating in the CBMs for the officials responsible for preparing submissions. The guide has no formal status and is not meant to place additional obligations on the States Parties. However, it can serve as a practical aid for those officials. It was mentioned in reference to the need for plain-language guides for policy-makers and officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\n',

In addition, these Guidelines call for intersectoral and interregional cooperation in relation to investigation and management of such events.  In case of a\ndeliberately caused outbreak this includes the identification of the perpetrator(s), attribution and prosecution, to serve justice but also to prevent further criminal acts involving pathogens or biological toxins.',
    Long_description:
      'The Guidelines for Investigation of Suspicious Biological Events was designed to fill a gap in the biosecurity landscape where veterinary laboratories and services were not being included in bioterrorism mitigation efforts and risk reduction. These Guidelines are meant to establish good practices for identifying biological events in animals that warrant further investigation, with an emphasis on collaborating with other agencies throughout the process. The Guidelines outline steps for pre-event planning, incident assessment, response operations and recovery, promoting a One Health approach throughout. It also provides a template for an evidence chain of custody tracking form that helps identify responsible parties in the case of an incident. \n\nThe Guidelines were published in 2018 by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as part of a larger biothreat reduction strategy, and are available in English. The OIE is an intergovernmental organization with 182 member countries. The organization is responsible for safeguarding and improving animal health worldwide. It is recognized as a reference organization by the World Trade Organization and maintains permanent relations with nearly 75 other international and regional organizations. The OIE champions a “One Health” approach to health security, which asserts that human and animal health are interdependent and that preventing diseases in animals is the most effective way to safeguard human health.\n\n\n',

      'The GLLP is a unique workforce development initiative led by six organizations (the GLLP Partners) working globally in the human, animal, and environmental health sectors. The goal of the GLLP is to foster and mentor current and emerging laboratory leaders to build, strengthen, and sustain national laboratory systems. The GLLP combines didactic learning with mentorship, practical experience, and a community of practice to support individual learning and laboratory systems strengthening. One of the nine core competencies in the GLLP framework is "Biosafety and Biosecurity".\n\n',
    Long_description:
      'The Global Laboratory Leadership Programme (GLLP) was developed to train laboratory staff in leadership and management in order to strengthen the operations of human, animal, and public health laboratories. The Programme was created through a partnership of six organizations: the US-based Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and World Health Organization (WHO). These six organizations brought together over 140 experts in human and animal health and laboratory science for the development of the GLLP. GLLP is also committed to employing a One Health Approach across all of its training programs and to equip laboratory leaders to implement a One Health approach in their own laboratories.\n\nAs part of the GLLP, the experts created a Laboratory Leadership Competency Framework that nine core competencies needed to meet national, regional, and global disease prevention and control objectives: 1. Laboratory System, 2. Disease Surveillance and Outbreak Investigation, 3. Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Recovery, 4. Biosafety and Biosecurity, 5. Leadership, 6. Management, 7. Communication, 8. Quality Management System, 9. Research. In addition to the Competency Framework, GLLP also offers a Learning Package which includes over 200 hours worth of virtual and in-person course materials, as well as a mentorship guide. The Framework and the Learning Package were published in 2019 and available in English. Together, these two components allow GLLP to set a standard for laboratory leadership training internationally. \n\n\n',

      'The GHSA is a global partnership of governments and international organizations to aims to increase global health security. It was founded in 2014 as a multilateral effort to close the IHR implementation gap. In 2017, the GHSA was renewed through 2024 (GHSA 2024) with the goal of having more than 100 countries complete an evaluation of health security capacity and undergo planning and resource mobilization to address gaps.',
    Long_description:
      'The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is a multilateral agreement to improve international compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR), especially related to preparedness to face threats posed by infectious diseases. The GHSA comprises 70 countries, international organizations and non-government organizations that work together to identify and fill gaps in country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats. The GHSA encourages collaboration between the health, security, environmental and agricultural sectors, and emphasizes that global health security should be a priority for national leaders. The GHSA focuses on common, measurable targets that can be easily understood by everyone who engages with it. \n\nThe GHSA was first founded in 2014 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States with a 5 year mandate, which was renewed for another five years in 2017. In the first phase of GHSA, the focus was on the evaluation of health security capacity, and they found that 70% of countries surveyed were prepared to address a global pandemic (this assessment was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic). In the second phase of the GHSA, which is currently ongoing, the focus is on planning and resource mobilization to close gaps and strengthen capacities. \nThe GHSA is governed by a Steering Group of 15 rotating GHSA members, whose main tasks are to provide strategic guidance, identify overall GHSA priorities and coordinate among GHSA members. \n\n',

GRAP is a joint framework from OIE and FAO of a post-eradication action plan that lays out the roles and responsibilities of international and regional stakeholders in the 5 stages of the emergency management cycle (prepare, prevent, detect, respond, recover) related to a potential re-emergence of rinderpest. ',
    Long_description:
      'The Global Rinderpest Action Plan (GRAP) is an international operational plan designed to make sure that rinderpest, a disease that affects livestock, stays eradicated. Rinderpest was eradicated in 2011 through a mass vaccination and surveillance effort, and is one of only two diseases to ever be eradicated, the other being smallpox. However, there are still stores of the rinderpest virus at laboratories in 24 countries, but there is decreasing expertise and access to diagnostics and vaccines in the wake of eradication. Therefore, GRAP was created to prevent, and prepare for, the potential reemergence of the virus. The Action Plan consists of 5 stages of emergency management : Prepare, Prevent, Detect, Respond and Recover. \n\nThe Action Plan was published in 2018 by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Both the OIE and FAO have had rinderpest mitigation as a top priority ever since their creation in 1924 and 1945, respectively. The Action Plan was funded by Global Affairs Canada (Weapons of Mass Destruction Threat Reduction Program), the United States of America Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Government of Japan. The Actional Plan was written to advise a large range of stakeholders, such as national governments, academics that work with the virus, livestock keepers, international organizations, development partners and the law enforcement sector. The Plan is available in English, Spanish, French, Arabic , Russian and Chinese. \n\n',

It allows users will to search and contrast desired aspects of the biosafety and biosecurity oversight approaches for any or all of the IEGBBR member countries. The Compendium serves as a useful reference tool for biosafety and biosecurity capacity building for IEGBBR members, as well as for countries that aim to develop or strengthen their national biosafety and biosecurity capacities. By providing 11 examples of national oversight systems, it can remove the necessity for extensive legwork prior to the development and implementation of oversight. ',
    Long_description:
      'The Compendium of International Biosafety and Biosecurity Oversight Systems for Human and Animal Pathogens and Toxins is a mobile application developed by the International Experts Group of Biosafety and Biosecurity Regulators (IEGBBR)  that allows users to search through detailed descriptions of the national regulatory oversight approaches from the 11 IEGBBR member countries. The application was made publicly available for free in the Google Play Store in 2019 in English and French. The Compendium was designed to help countries strengthen their national and regional compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR) by allowing users to compare between the member countries IHR implementations. It can also be used to help support the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) implementation. The Compendium works as both a reference library and a capacity building tool. \n\nIEGBBR was founded in 2007 under the leadership of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The Group brings together regulatory authorities from the 11 member countries that are responsible for regulatory oversight of biosafety and biosecurity in their country to share expertise and lessons learned from their regulatory systems. The 11 member states are: Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The World Health Organization and the World Organization Organisation for Animal Health are non-member observers. In addition to the Compendium, IEGBBR publishes other reference materials for the benefit of the international community, such as their forthcoming review of oversight of dual-use in life sciences.\n\n\n',

      'The Certification Program for Biorisk Management is an internationally-recognized professional certification for biorisk and biosafety. Candidates receive the Certification once they have passed the qualifying exams and Certifications must be renewed every 5 years to ensure continued competence. The initial exams cost $200 USD and the recertification fee is $150 USD, although there are discounted prices ($100 USD and $70 USD respectively) for qualifying professionals from resource-limited countries. The content outline for each exam is available online, free of cost, and covers the domains, tasks, and knowledge that will be tested on the exam. The online exams are offered in English and the paper-based exams are offered in English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish & Russian. \n\nThe Biorisk Management Certification is the first of 5 certifications offered by the International Federation of Biosafety Associations (IFBA). Biorisk Management is a prerequisite for the other four courses: Biowaste management, Biocontainment Facility design, Biosafety Cabinet Selection, and Biosecurity. The certification program started in 2014, and the 3rd edition was released in March 2020. IFBA is a network of regional and national biosafety associations from around the world that have a mandate in biosafety, biosecurity and biorisk management. In addition to the Certification program, they also offer a mentorship program designed to provide local guidance to mentees interested in obtaining their Certifications from mentors that have completed the process.\n\n\n',

      'The  European Committee for Standardization (CEN)  Workshop Agreement 16393 (CWA 16393): Laboratory Biorisk Management Standard- Guidelines for Implementation of CWA 15793: Laboratory Biorisk Management Standard is a companion guide that focuses on how to carry out the plan-do-check-act cycle outlined in CWA 15793. CWA 16393 was published in 2011, when CWA 15793 was being updated, and the document is structured as implementation guidance notes surrounding the CWA 155793 text. These Guidelines do not add any new requirements, and are meant to give context to existing requirements. The document is available in English, French and German. \n\nCEN is a public standards organization that aims to foster the economy, global trading, environment, and public welfare of the European continent. CEN has hosted 84 workshops as of September 2021. These workshops address emerging or rapidly evolving technologies that require quickly developed specifications and research. The main outcome of a CEN workshop is a CEN Workshop Agreement, a voluntary agreement with international applicability. CEN members are the national standards bodies of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom.\n\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'The  European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Workshop Agreement 15793 (CWA 15973): Laboratory Biorisk Management Standard is a management systems approach that implements a plan-do-check-act cycle to identify, monitor and control laboratory biosafety and biosecurity. The Standard was prepared through a CEN workshop on Laboratory biosafety and biosecurity which was attended by 76 experts from around the world. It was published in 2008, and updated in 2011, and is available in English, French and German. This Standard comes with a companion implementation guide, CWA 16393, and provided the foundation for ISO 35001: Biorisk management for laboratories and other related organisations which was published in 2019 (both resources have their own entry in this library). \n\nCEN is a public standards organization that aims to foster the economy, global trading, environment, and public welfare of the European continent. CEN has hosted 84 workshops as of September 2021. These workshops address emerging or rapidly evolving technologies that require quickly developed specifications and research. The main outcome of a CEN workshop is a CEN Workshop Agreement, a voluntary agreement with international applicability. CEN members are the national standards bodies of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom.\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) Legislation Database is a collection of national laws that States use to implement their obligations under the BWC, and contains examples of legislation covering criminal provisions, biosafety and biosecurity measures, export control measures and enforcement. The database is published and maintained by Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC) through a combination of national surveys that VERTIC administers and laws and regulations that VERTIC staff locates through open sources. The database was first published in 2002, significantly expanded in 2010, and is updated as new surveys are completed. There are over 1500 laws and regulations in the database, each of which is available in the language it was originally published in. Some of the non-English entries have been translated into English. \n\nVERTIC is based in the UK and works on all types of verification schemes for international agreements. VERTIC has three main programs: 1. Verification and Monitoring, 2. National Implementation Measures, 3. Compliance Mechanisms and Measures. This tool is under the national implementation program for the BWC. Under the Implementing the Biological Weapons Convention program there are several tools: International Agreements, Legislative Assistance Provider, Legislation Drafting Tools, Legislation Drafting Assistant, Legislative Analysis Tool, Universality of the BWC, National Implementation Measures, and Fact Sheets. Many of these tools have their own entries in this library.\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'The Fact Sheets on the Biological Weapons Conventions (BWC) are a series of frequently asked questions guides about countries obligations under the BWC. The fact sheets focus on destruction of bioweapons stockpiles and on national authority for the bioweapons convention. The factsheets include questions such as “is my state under an obligation to implement the BWC?” and “How can my state establish a national authority?”. The factsheets also give information about who to contact to receive assistance to set up BWC protocols. The factsheets are available in English, Spanish, French, and Arabic, and were published in 2021. \n\nVerification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC) is based in the UK and works on all types of verification schemes for international agreements. VERTIC has three main programs: 1. Verification and Monitoring, 2. National Implementation Measures, 3. Compliance Mechanisms and Measures. This tool is under the national implementation program for the BWC. Under the Implementing the Biological Weapons Convention program there are several tools: International Agreements, Legislative Assistance Provider, Legislation Drafting Tools, Legislation Drafting Assistant, Legislative Analysis Tool, BWC Legislation Database, Universality of the BWC, and National Implementation Measures. Many of these tools have their own entries in this library.\n\n\n',

    Short_description:
      'The Australia Group is an informal agreement between countries that create export controls that aim to minimize the risk of assisting chemical or biological weapons proliferation. It publishes a list of controlled substances (i.e. viruses, bacteria, toxins, and fungi) and controlled equipment (ex. fermentors, clean room filters and certain software). The Australia Group relies on national legislatures to enact the suggested export control list. ',
    Long_description:
      'The Australia Group: Biological Weapons-Related Common Control Lists are lists of export controlled materials and equipment that could be potential precursors to bioweapons. The list includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, toxins, and genetic elements of any of the materials that impact humans, animals and/or plants. A separate list includes dual use biological equipment such as fermenters, containment equipment, and software used by biologists.  The Australia Group is an informal, voluntary network of countries that aims to reduce the proliferation of biological and chemical weapons. In addition to providing control lists, the group also provides guidelines for responsible transfer of these materials and appropriate trade controls. Members of the Australia Group implement the export control lists and guidelines  in their national legislation. \n\nThe Australia Group was originally founded in 1985 in response to chemical weapons use in the Iran-Iraq war, and was expanded to cover biological weapons in the early 1990s.  The Group originally had 15 participating countries, and currently has 42 plus the European Commission. The Group was designed to support the activities of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The Group has annual meetings to keep the lists up to date. The lists are available in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Russian and Dutch. \n\n\n',

      'The Bloodborne pathogens in the lab: minimize exposure & prevent infection training is a course for members of the European Biosafety Association (EBSA). EBSA is an association that establishes and communicates best biosafety and biosecurity practices to its members and encourages dialogue and discussions on developing issues. EBSA also represents and defends the collective interests of its members in all areas relating to biosafety and biosecurity, specifically as it relates to emerging legislation in Europe and internationally. Founded in 1996,  the Association has 426 individual members, representing over 24 countries in Europe, as well as other regions. EBSA is a good example of regional cooperation amongst biosafety and biosecurity practitioners. \n\nThe training is a two and a half hour course on how to work safely with blood and blood containing materials in various types of laboratories. The training includes exercises that aim to highlight the safety material covered, and covers relevant International and European regulations, including CEN Workshop Agreement (CEN) 15793:2011  The training is taught by Dana Brehar-Cioflec and Heather Sheeley. The cost of the course is 100 euro for EBSA members. The course is one of several trainings available to EBSA members, as well as other Biosafety and Biosecurity resources.

      'The Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines (CBS) outline a harmonized national standard that set the requirements for regulated laboratories and other containment zones handling human or animal pathogens, toxins, and plant pests. The CBS covers physical containment, operational practice, and testing requirements that verify the safe handling of pathogens and toxins. The CBS champions a risk, evidence and performanced based approach to biosafety, similar to the approach in the fourth edition of the WHO Lab Biosafety Manual, which was published in 2020. In addition to the standards and guidelines, Canada provides a free Biosafety Standards app to find specific containment requirements. They also publish all their communications about containment to their site. \n\nThe guidelines are currently on their second edition, which was published in March 2015. The CBS is available in English and French. The standards and guidelines are part of a larger suite of biosafety and biosecurity resources maintained by the Canadian Centre for Biosecurity in collaboration with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada. The Centre has 4 offices that focus on biosecurity: 1. Office of Biosafety Programs and Planning (OBPP), 2. Office of Biosafety and Biocontainment Operations (OBBO), 3. Office of Pathogen Security (OPS), 4. Office of Stakeholder Engagement and Regulatory Affairs (OSERA). \n\n\n',

      'The Biosecurity Resource Center at the Iowa State University Center for Food Security and Public Health (CFSPH) contains training, planning guides and fact sheets on biosecurity in animal operations aimed at preventing disease outbreaks in livestock. It contains resources on general agricultural biosecurity, such as animal movement, feed and disposal, as well as specific recommendations for beef, dairy, poultry, sheep and swine biosecurity. The Resource Center also provides resources for trainers and “train the trainer” sessions, and requests that trainers submit a training report to CFSPH. The resources in the Center are available in English and Spanish. \n\nThe Biosecurity Resource Center materials were developed using funding from the the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service through the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program (NADPRP) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture. CFSPH is a part of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University, and has been designated as an OIE Collaborating Center for Day-One Veterinary Competencies and Continuing Education since 2016. The Resource Center contains biosecurity information useful to anyone working in the agricultural industry, and the CFSPH, by being directly embedded in the Veterinary School and collaborating with OIE, is a good example of the power of embedding security expertise directly into an educational program and curriculum. \n',

    Long_description:
      "The Biosecurity Guide for Pork Producers aims to help pork producers evaluate their farms' biosecurity strengths and weaknesses through a guided checklist of biosecurity practices. Each question in the checklist ranks practices on a 4-point scale, unacceptable, questionable, adequate, and excellent, and provides information about why certain practices can be harmful. The checklist covers isolation biosecurity and indirect spread, mainly focused on making sure new additions to a flock do not introduce foriegn pathogens and that flocks do not spread any pathogens to other farms or to humans. \n\nThe guide was published in 2002 by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) at the United States Department of Agriculture. APHIS also publishes guidelines for poultry (see Defend the Flock entry in this library), cattle, horses and other domesticated and wild animals. The guide was developed in collaboration with the National Pork Board and the American Association of Swine Veterinarians. The guide is available in English.\n\n\n",

      'The Biological Weapons Convention Report on National Implementing Legislation is a compilation of insights on the status and trends of national implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), particularly Articles III and IV, and related provisions in UN Security Council Resolution 1540. This report was prepared for the Eighth Review Conference of the BWC that took place in November 2016. This report is published by Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC), which is based in the UK and works on all types of verification schemes for international agreements. For this report, VERTIC conducted a survey of 131 Member States to the BWC, 6 States who are signatories of the BWC, and 9 States who do not participate in the BWC. VERTIC collated and analyzed the results of the survey that serve as the foundation of this report. The survey template is available in English, Arabic, Dutch, French, Georgian, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish, and the report is available in English, French, Spanish and Russian. \n\nVERTIC has three main programs: 1. Verification and Monitoring, 2. National Implementation Measures, 3. Compliance Mechanisms and Measures. This tool is under the national implementation program for the BWC. Under the Implementing the Biological Weapons Convention program there are several tools: International Agreements, Legislative Assistance Provider, Legislation Drafting Tools, Legislation Drafting Assistant, Legislative Analysis Tool, BWC Legislation Database, Universality of the BWC, National Implementation Measures, and Fact Sheets. Many of these tools have their own entries in this library. This report is a good example of the power of surveying the international community and gives a good overview of the state of national implementation initiatives.\n',

    Long_description:
      'The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) is an international agreement that prohibits States from developing, producing or stockpiling biological weapons. Biological weapons are defined as biological agents that have no justification for peaceful purposes and/or are being used in a non-peaceful way. The BWC is the first global treaty to ban an entire category of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). The BWC has ten main articles that countries agree to when signing onto the treaty: 1. Definition of biological weapons and prohibition against development, 2. Agreement to destroy all existing biological weapons within 9 months of entering the treaty, 3. Prohibition against transferring biological weapons to any other State or non-State actors, 4. Requirement for national implementation of the BWC, 5. Agreement to cooperate to solve any problems related to the BWC, 6. Procedure for lodging a formal complaint against another country through the UN Security Council, 7. Agreement to support any nation that has been harmed through a violation of the BWC, 8. The BWC is in addition to the Geneva Convention of 1925, 9. Agreement to also enter into good faith negotiations to prohibit chemical weapons, 10. States will assist one another in building peaceful biological capacity and the BWC be implemented so as not to hamper any technological development of peaceful biological capacity. \n\nThe BWC entered into force in March 1975 and currently has 183 States signed onto the treaty. In 2006, the BWC Implementation Support Unit (ISU) was established to provide administrative support to the BWC, support national implementation efforts, receive and distribute confidence building measures, and maintain a database for the exchange of relevant information. The BWC is available in all official UN languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian.\n\n',

    Long_description:
      'The Best Practice Guidelines on Biosecurity for Biological Resource Centres (BRCs) set out the protocols for operating BRCs, which are repositories of living cells, components of living cells such as genomes and information about biological materials and processes stored in databases. BRCs range in size and capabilities, but they share a need to keep their materials and data secure against loss or theft. The guidelines outline a risk assessment approach for the wide variety of materials and data that might be stored in a BRC; the first step of the assessment is to assign each material one of four biosecurity risk levels, and the second steps walks users through what measures need to be taken based on the risk level of the material. The goal of the guidelines is to establish biosecurity without being overbearing. \n\nThe guidelines were published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2007. The OECD is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1961 that has 38 member countries that work together to stimulate economic progress. The OECD began advocating for the development of BRCs in 2001 in order to meet the growing demand for biotechnology resources and help spur further biotechnology development. In addition to the biosecurity guidelines, the OECD also released quality guidelines in 2007 to make sure the materials in BRCs were safe and effective. The biosecurity guidelines are available in English and Spanish. \n\n\n',

It also provides a framework for rapid policy development as unforeseen risks emerge during an EAD Response. Additionally, it provides reference materials for Australian EAD response training and exercises. The 1st edition of the AUSVETPLAN was published in 1991 and the 5th edition was released in July 2021. The plan is available in English.\n\n\n',

      'The Defend the Flock Educational Program aims to help poultry producers evaluate their flocks’ biosecurity strengths and weaknesses through guided checklists of biosecurity practices. There are 15 checklists that cover topics such as disinfection of enclosures, visitor guidelines, isolation of new flocks, and biosecurity training. In addition to the checklists, the program provides resource guides, videos and a #FlockDefender youth engagement program. The Defend the Flock program also has a social media presence that works to bring awareness of flock biosecurity to a wider audience. \n\nThe program was started in 2013 by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) at the United States Department of Agriculture. APHIS also publishes guidelines for pork (see Biosecurity Guide for Pork Producersentry in this library), cattle, horses and other domesticated and wild animals.  The checklists are available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. \n\n\n',

      'An Efficient and Practical Approach to Biosecurity is a book published by the Danish Center for Biorisk and Biosecurity (CBB) after Denmark passed a comprehensive biosecurity law in 2008. The book details an efficient and practical model that other countries can use as a blueprint for establishing or improving their own biosecurity systems. It covers setting up a biosecurity system, biosecurity in practice, and thorny biosecurity challenges. The book was published in 2015, and free to download from the CBB website. The book is available in English and Russian. \n\nThe CBB is Denmark’s national authority on biosecurity that issues licences to research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, hospital laboratories, and other laboratories that handle biological materials to allow them to work with biological dual use components. CBB was established to help Denmark fulfill its responsibilities under Security Council Resolution 1540, and reports to the Ministry of Health. CBB also maintains  a 24/7 response capability to counter the effects of a biological incident, both accidental and malicious. \n\n\n',

      'Canada has developed An Analytical Approach for the Development of a National Biosafety and Biosecurity System, a tool to strengthen global biosafety and biosecurity. This tool is available both as an online course, and as a downloadable PDF manual. The Analytical Approach is meant to be used by interested countries and regions, ultimately contributing to global biosafety and biosecurity capacity. It provides a methodology for regional, national or local authorities to develop, modernize, implement and maintain national biosafety and biosecurity systems to mitigate the risks of a natural, accidental or deliberate release of biological agents. A complete biosafety and biosecurity system encompasses a legal structure that provides a mandate for an oversight program, along with a policy framework, education and training, and a culture of responsible conduct.',
    Long_description:
      "The Analytical Approach: biosafety and biosecurity oversight framework is a tool to help countries and regions strengthen their biosafety and biosecurity capacity by implementing, modernizing, and maintaining national biosafety and biosecurity oversight systems. The framework has a particular focus on mitigating the public health risks posed by the use of pathogens and toxins in biological laboratories. The tool is designed in a modular, scalable and flexible format that allows countries to adapt the Approach to their unique needs and work through the methodology independently. The Approach can be used by countries at any stage of oversight development, such as those who: already have a framework and wish to validate it, wish to update or modernize their current framework, and have no oversight in place. The tool has examples and sample exercises, workshop outlines, templates for organizing and gathering data, and other resources available in English and French through an online course or downloadable PDF that can be accessed by creating a free account. \n\nThe Analytical Approach is part of a larger suite of biosafety and biosecurity resources maintained by the Canadian Centre for Biosecurity in collaboration with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada and PHAC. The Centre has 4 offices that focus on biosecurity: 1. Office of Biosafety Programs and Planning (OBPP), 2. Office of Biosafety and Biocontainment Operations (OBBO) , 3. Office of Pathogen Security (OPS), 4. Office of Stakeholder Engagement and Regulatory Affairs (OSERA). This project was funded by Global Affairs Canada's Weapons Threat Reduction Program. \n\n",

The report was prepared by Africa CDC in coordination with its regional and international partners, including but not limited to the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), Food and Agricultural Organization of the United States (FAO), the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), and the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The regional priorities identified by this report can inform the Biosafety and Biosecurity 5 Year Strategic Plan (2021-2025) and priorities amongst member states.",
    Long_description:
      'In May 2019, Africa CDC launched the Biosafety and Biosecurity Initiative (BBI). Africa CDC released the BBI in response to the WHO Joint External Evaluations (JEE) conducted by African Union (AU) member states between 2016 and 2019 and the 2019 GHSI. Both evaluations demonstrated weak biosafety and biosecurity capabilities amongst the member states. The BBI aimed to strengthen those capabilities in compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR), the Biological Weapons Convent (BWC), and the United Nations Security Resolution (UNSCR) 1540.  As a part of that effort, Africa CDC planned a series of workshops aimed at identifying regional priorities amongst member states. This report summarizes the process, findings, and proposed next steps that emerged from those workshops.\n\nThe following organizations participated in the workshops: Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), and United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) and Global Affairs Canada Weapons Threat Reduction Program provided resources for the Africa CDC staff hosting the workshops. The participants identified key gaps in Southern Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, Western Africa, and Northern Africa. These priorities formed the basis for the Africa CDC Biosafety and Biosecurity Five Year Strategic Plan. A table at the end of the document outlines how the 5-Year Plan addresses the identified gaps. The plan and the priorities may be of interest to any regional or international partners with a special interest in capacity building in these areas, and Africa CDC is an excellent example of a regional collaboration. As of September 2021, the guide is only available in English.\n\n\n',

      "The World Health Organization (WHO) BioHub System is a network of coordinated BioHub Facilities that enable the rapid sharing of viruses and other pathogens globally. The Facilities will receive, sequence, store and ship these pathogens to labs around the world under pre-agreed conditions that include biosafety and biosecurity, this way new agreements do not have to be signed every time pathogen samples move. Rapid sharing of pathogens is key to understanding and preventing the spread of viruses and pathogens with pandemic potential. The BioHubs will enable countries to do risk assessment of emerging diseases under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and allow medical countermeasures to be developed in a timely fashion.  \n\nThe BioHub effort is currently in its pilot phase, with one Facility opening in Switzerland. During the testing phase, SARS-COV2 will be the test sample for the non-commercial sharing of Biological Materials with Epidemic or Pandemic Potential (BMEPP). The WHO is asking countries to share and receive SARS-COV2 samples with the BioHub under Standard Material Transfer Agreements (SMTA). Working with the BioHub system is completely voluntary for countries and the system is designed to link into a country's trusted laboratory and repository networks. The initial concept note outlining this system was published in April 2021 and the next update is scheduled for the end of 2022. \n\n\n",

      "The World Health Organization's (WHO) Laboratory Biosafety Manual (LBM) informs best practices for safely handling pathogenic biological agents in laboratories. It consists of a core document that explains the evidence and risk based approach that LBM uses. It also contains 7 subject specific monographs on topics ranging from risk assessment to waste management to laboratory design, each of which has their own entry in this library. The manual aims to be technology-neutral and cost-effective by focusing on a risk based approach that can be applied in a locally relevant and sustainable way in laboratories across the world. \n\nThese guidelines were mentioned by almost every expert that we interviewed for this library, and have been fundamental to laboratory biosafety since the first edition was released in 1983. While the standards outlined in this manual are not legally binding, they have become the defacto global standard for biosafety and have inspired many national codes. These guidelines are developed with experts from around the world, and were most recently updated for the fourth edition in 2020, which places a larger emphasis on an evidence and risk based approach to biosafety and biosecurity. Previous editions of the manual have been published in 13 languages, although, as of the last time this library was updated, the 4th edition was only available in English. The development of the manual is led by the Biosecurtity and Health Security Interface at the WHO, a team who also supports national implementation efforts of the International Health Regulations and emergency preparedness.  \n",

    Short_description:
      "This report describes actions needed to create an ideal future for biosecurity in 2030 and follows a similar 2014 report that highlighted forthcoming biosecurity trends and challenges. The goal of the report is to provoke new considerations around Australia's expansive biosecurity system, which includes world-class animal health facilities like the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP). While this report centers on Australian biosecurity, the key insights and implications may be useful to those in industry, research, the government, or the general community thinking about biosecurity challenges.",
    Long_description:
      'The report describes an ideal 2030 future state of biosecurity in Australia and actions needed in the agricultural, environmental, and marine sectors to reach that state. This report was published by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Australian government agency responsible for scientific research. It follows a 2014 publication which identified major biosecurity trends and shocks in Australia’s biosecurity landscape. That 2014 publication was aimed at the same sectors and is publicly available as well.\n\nThis resource was included in part to highlight the work of CSIRO and other Australian biosecurity organizations. CSIRO includes several facilities, including the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP), a world class animal health facility. The ACDP is currently developing new tools for biosecurity education that may be included in this library in the future. Until then, we included this document to highlight existing resources from the Australian groups. While the key recommendations and observations are tailored to an Australian audience and Australia’s unique biosecurity environment, some of the discussion may help inform the national biosecurity agenda of other nations. \n\n\n',
