import CMSIcon from './BIT_PLAYGROUND_ONLY/DEMO_AirtableCMSIcon'

# Setup

This component requires an airtable configured with two columns, `Name` and `SVG`.

The `talus-gatsby-transformer-svg` plugin must be installed and enabled in `gatsby-config.js`.

The `gatsby-source-airtable` plugin must be configured with the Icons table:

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-airtable`,
      options: {
        tables: [
          {
            baseId: `appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`,
            tableName: `Icons`,
            view: `CMS View`,
            mapping: { SVG: `fileNode` },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

The `mapping: {SVG: 'fileNode'}` call tells `gatsby-plugin-airtable` to download the
attachment as a file; from there `talus-gatsby-transformer-svg` will automatically
recognize the node and make the SVG file contents available to the `<AirtableCMSIcon/>`
component.

# Example usage

This is using a pre-saved query result; the same as when Gatsby runs the query and
transforms the result into a static `.json` file.

**Available icons are "Syringe" and "Learn more"**

```js live
// prettier-ignore
() => (
  <CMSIcon
    name="Syringe"
    color="#282e40"
    hoverColor="#45a26a"
    style={{ height: 100, padding: 30 }}
  />
)
```

# Exported utilities and hooks

## General purpose hook: `useCMSIcon()`

```js
interface Icon {
  svg: string
  text: string
}

function useCMSIcon(name: string, color: string): Icon
function useCMSIcon( name: string, color: string, noEmitError: true): Icon | undefined
function useCMSIcon( name: string, color: string, noEmitError: boolean): Icon | undefined
```

This hook returns a specific icon by name, as an SVG string, in the color specified. By default, the hook will always either return an icon or throw an error, but if `noEmitError` is `true`, the hook may also return `undefined` if the icon isn't present in the airtable query.

This hook is useful when it is necessary to use the SVG string in some way where `<CMSIcon/>` will not work, for example if further manipulation is necessary or if it needs to be inserted in a different container element. The `<CMSIcon/>` component should be preferred.

## Batch-processing optimized hook: `useAllCMSIcons()`

```js
type useAllCMSIcons = () => {
  name: string
  svg: HTMLElement
  text: string
}[]
```

This hook retures all the icons from Airtable, pre-processed into HTML elements, with their default colors from Airtable. This is a special-use hook which is intended for use in a component which will mount once and then use lots of icons, in lots of colors, and needs to do that very quickly, such as animated displays or situations where user interaction might update colors of many icons at the same time. This function is vast majority of the time.

In general use this hook should be avoided, as it has a much slower startup time the first time it is called on component mount. However, after the startup, subsequent calls using `replaceFill()` on these SVGs will be around 10x faster than the general-use `useCMSIcon()` hook.

When the SVG string is needed, get it with the `svg.toString()` method.

## Utility function: `replaceFill()`

```js
function replaceFill(svg: string, color: string): string
function replaceFill(svg: HTMLElement, color: string): HTMLElement
```

This function handles parsing SVG graphics and re-coloring them. It will change any `fill` and `stroke` attribute in the SVG to the specified color, supporting any color format supported by the SVG specification. Recoloring itself is recursive, so this function will traverse the node structure and recolor elements even if they are inside groups or other containing elements.

There is a short-circuit optimization for use with `useAllCMSIcons()` where this function will not re-parse the SVG if it is already passed in as an `HTMLElement`, and in that case it will return an `HTMLElement`.
