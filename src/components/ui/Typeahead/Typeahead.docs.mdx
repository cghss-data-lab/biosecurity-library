## React Component for rendering a single or multiple selection control

Takes an array of items, which must have "key" and "label" properties, but can have
any additional properties as necessary, and allows the user to search through and
select them. The control can be used with just the mouse, just the keyboard, or a
combination of the two.

### Component usage

Simple usage example of multiple select component. This component is designed to work
in different situations with different state management (useState or useReducer, for
example), so the parent component is expected to set that up.

Modify the placeholder text, add items, or add other props to see changes live:

```js live
// prettier-ignore
() => {
  const exampleItems = [
    { key: '1', label: 'item one' },
    { key: '2', label: 'item two' },
    { key: '3', label: 'another item' },
  ]

  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState([])
  const selectedKeys = selected.map(i => i.key)
  const unselected = exampleItems.filter(i => !selectedKeys.includes(i.key))

  return (
    <Typeahead
      multiselect
      placeholder={`${selected.length} items selected`}
      items={unselected}
      values={selected}
      onAdd={item => setSelected(prev => [...prev, item])}
      onRemove={item =>
        setSelected(prev => prev.filter(i => i.key !== item.key))
      }
      style={{ width: 300 }}
    />
  )
}
```
