## React Component for rendering a single or multiple selection control

Takes an array of items, which must have "key" and "label" properties, but can have
any additional properties as necessary, and allows the user to search through and
select them. The control can be used with just the mouse, just the keyboard, or a
combination of the two.

### Component usage

Simple usage example of multiple select component. This component is designed to work
in different situations with different state management (useState or useReducer, for
example), so the parent component is expected to set that up.

Modify the placeholder text, add items, or add other props to see changes live:

```js live
// prettier-ignore
() => {
  const exampleItems = [
    { key: '1', label: 'item one' },
    { key: '2', label: 'item two' },
    { key: '3', label: 'another item' },
  ]

  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState([])
  const selectedKeys = selected.map(i => i.key)
  const unselected = exampleItems.filter(i => !selectedKeys.includes(i.key))

  return (
    <Typeahead
      multiselect
      placeholder={`${selected.length} items selected`}
      items={unselected}
      values={selected}
      onAdd={item => setSelected(prev => [...prev, item])}
      onRemove={item =>
        setSelected(prev => prev.filter(i => i.key !== item.key))
      }
      style={{ width: 300 }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Icon customization

The Typeahead can take a URI escaped SVG as an icon replacement; one easy way to get that is to use [this tool](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/) and take the text from the "Take Encoded" box (second one).

That encoded string can be passed to the iconSVG prop:

```js
<Typeahead
  //...other props
  iconSVG="%3Csvg width='24' height='24' viewBox='0 0 24 24' fill='none' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cpath d='M6 9L12 15L18 9H6Z' fill='%23333333'/%3E%3C/svg%3E%0A"
/>
```

> Note: _The encoded string should always start with `%C3svg` and quotes must be single quotes._
